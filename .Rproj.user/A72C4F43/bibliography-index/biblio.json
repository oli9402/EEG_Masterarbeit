            "abstract": "Background: The current study presents the results of a meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of ACT, including 1,821 patients with mental disorders or somatic health problems. Methods: We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Information provided by the Association of Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS) community was also included. Statistical calculations were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Study quality was rated using a methodology rating form. Results: ACT outperformed control conditions (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0.57) at post-treatment and follow-up, in completer and intent-to-treat analyses for primary outcomes. ACT was superior to waitlist (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0.82), to psychological placebo (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0.51) and to TAU (Hedges‚Äô g = 0.64). ACT was also superior on secondary outcomes (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0.30), life satisfaction/quality measures (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0.37) and process measures (Hedges‚Äôs g = 0. 56) when compared to control conditions. The comparison between ACT and established treatments (i.e., CBT) did not reveal any significant differences between these treatments (p = .140). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ACT is more effective than treatment as usual or placebo and that ACT may be as effective in treating anxiety disorders, depression, addiction, and somatic health problems as established psychological interventions. More research that focuses on quality of life and processes of change is needed to understand the added value of ACT and its trans diagnostic nature.",

            "abstract": "Baseline correction plays an important role in past and current methodological debates in ERP research (e.g., the Tanner vs. Maess debate in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods), serving as a potential alternative to strong high-pass filtering. However, the very assumptions that underlie traditional baseline also undermine it, implying a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. In other words, traditional baseline correction is statistically unnecessary and even undesirable. Including the baseline interval as a predictor in a GLM-based statistical approach allows the data to determine how much baseline correction is needed, including both full traditional and no baseline correction as special cases. This reduces the amount of variance in the residual error term and thus has the potential to increase statistical power.",

            "abstract": "Objective:¬† Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence‚Äîwith a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies‚Äîis presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices‚Äîautomated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables‚Äîare shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.",

            "abstract": "For more than sixty years, the gold standard for assessing aversive conditioning in humans has been the skin conductance response (SCR), which arises from the activation of the peripheral nervous system. Although the SCR has been proven useful, it has some properties that impact the kinds of questions it can be used to answer. In particular, the SCR is slow, reaching a peak 4‚Äì5 seconds after stimulus onset, and it decreases in amplitude after a few trials (habituation). The present study asked whether the late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform could be a useful complementary method for assessing aversive conditioning in humans. The SCR and LPP were measured in an aversive conditioning paradigm consisting of three blocks in which one color was paired with a loud noise (CS+) and other colors were not paired with the noise (CS‚àí). Participants also reported the perceived likelihood of being exposed to the noise for each color. Both SCR and LPP were significantly larger on CS+ trials than on CS‚àí trials. However, SCR decreased steeply after the first conditioning block whereas LPP and self-reports were stable over blocks. These results indicate that the LPP can be used to assess aversive conditioning and has several useful properties: 1) it is a direct response of the central nervous system; 2) it is fast, with an onset latency of 300 ms; 3) it does not habituate over time.",

            "abstract": "People tend to attach less value to a good if they know a delay will occur before they obtain it. For example, people value receiving $100 tomorrow more than receiving $100 in 10 years. We explored one reason for this tendency (due to Parfit, 1984): In terms of psychological properties, such as beliefs, values, and goals, the decision maker is more closely linked to the person (his or her future self) receiving $100 tomorrow than to the person receiving $100 in 10 years. For this reason, he or she prefers his or her nearer self to have the $100 rather than his or her more remote self. Studies 1 and 2 showed that the greater the rated psychological connection between 2 parts of a participant‚Äôs life, the less he or she discounted future monetary and nonmonetary benefits (e.g., good days at work) over that interval. In Studies 3‚Äì5, participants read about characters who undergo large life-changing (and connectedness-weakening) events at different points in their lives and then made decisions about the timing of benefits on behalf of these characters. All 5 studies revealed a relation between perceived psychological connectedness and intertemporal choice: Participants preferred benefits to occur before large changes in connectedness but preferred costs to occur after these changes.

            "abstract": "Network approaches that investigate the interaction between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in recent years. In parallel, network approaches that characterise the interaction between brain regions have become the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that are associated with each node in the psychometric network (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic traits and their resting-state functional connectivity associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male autistic participants (10‚Äì21 years) from the autism brain data exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our results indicate that the network-based regression approach can uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the overlap between communication and social difficulties is not reflected in the overlap between their functional brain correlates.The article introduces a method to combine common practices in network psychometrics and network neuroimaging. Namely, we use the unique variance in behavioural measures as regressors to identify unique neural correlates. This enables the description of brain-level and behavioural-level data into a joint network while keeping the dimensionality of the results manageable and interpretable. We illustrate this approach by showing the network of autistic traits and their correlates in resting-state functional connectivity.",

Objective: To describe both models and discusses the weakness and reductionism of the brain disease model following the consumption of heroin by North American soldiers in the Vietnam war in the 1970s. Method: A literature review of the Vietnam Veteran Study in relation to drug consumption. Results: The soldiers greatly increased their consumption of heroin in Vietnam, but almost all of them ceased using it upon returning home. The analysis of the environmental factors related to this self-healing is a critique of the brain disease model of addictions because it cannot explain this or other studies. Conclusion: The biopsychosocial model is still the best model to guide the field of addiction due to its utility, coherence, and efficacy in treatment.",

            "abstract": "We compared the effect of locking the event-related potentials (ERPs) on the stimulus vs. the response in a simple (SRT) and in a discriminative (DRT, equally probable Go/No-go) visuo-motor task. The accurate alignment of stimulus- and response-locked ERPs on the same time scale was obtained selecting a group of 27 participants with low inter-individual response time (RT) variation in the two tasks to reduce the jitter of RTs. Two-second epochs were defined for the analyses based on averaged RTs in the two tasks. Results show that the preparatory pre-stimulus activities (i.e., the pN and the BP components) were not affected by the different locking in both SRT and DRT. As expected, the exogenous post-stimulus P1 and N1 components (and the P2, present only in SRT) were larger in stimulus- than response-locked averaging; the same trend was observed for the less-known prefrontal N1 and P1 components (pN1 and pP1) that were larger in stimulus-locked averaging (the effect was not significant in SRT). The prefrontal pP2 component was only present in DRT peaking around 370 ms, and did not show an effect of locking. The frontal-central N2 component was enhanced by response-locked averaging in SRT, while it did not show effects of locking in DRT. The P3 component peaked at about 350 ms over central sites in SRT, and at about 500 ms over parietal sites in DRT; in both cases its amplitude was larger in response- than in stimulus-locked averaging. Overall, the amplitude of the preparatory components was independent from locking, the exogenous components were enhanced by stimulus locking, and the late components were more related to the response than to the stimulus. Concluding, to investigate action preparation, perception, and perceptual-decisional activity ERP studies should adopt stimulus-locked averaging with an appropriate baseline and longer pre-stimulus interval, or use both types of locking.",

            "abstract": "Deficits in general emotion regulation skills have been shown to be associated with various mental disorders. Thus, general affect-regulation training has been proposed as promising transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of psychopathology. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a general affect-regulation as a stand-alone, group-based treatment for depression. For this purpose, we randomly assigned 218 individuals who met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) to the Affect Regulation Training (ART), to a waitlist control condition (WLC), or to a condition controlling for common factors (CFC). The primary outcome was the course of depressive symptom severity as assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. Multi-level analyses indicated that participation in ART was associated with a greater reduction of depressive symptom severity than was participation in WLC (d = 0.56), whereas the slight superiority of ART over CFC (d = 0.25) was not statistically significant. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in emotion regulation skills mediated the differences between ART/CFC and WLC. Thus, the findings provide evidence for enhancing emotion regulation skills as a common mechanism of change in psychological treatments for depression. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01330485) and was supported by grants from the German Research Association (DFG; BE 4510/3-1; HI 456/6-2). Future research should compare the (cost-) efficacy of ART with that of disorder-specific interventions.",

            "abstract": "Objectives Deficits in emotion regulation (ER) have been shown to be associated with binge-eating disorder (BED). To further clarify the causal nature of this association, we tested whether systematically enhancing ER skills would reduce symptoms of BED. Methods We randomly allocated N = 101 individuals meeting the criteria for BED to a transdiagnostic ER skills training or to a waitlist control condition (WLC). Primary outcome was the reduction in binges during the treatment-vs.-waiting period as assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview. Results Mixed-model ANOVAs indicated that the average pre-to-post decrease in binges assessed with the EDE was significantly greater in the ER skills training condition than in the WLC (d = 0.66). These effects were stable over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.72). Remission rates at post/follow-up were 34.4/45.0% in the skills training and 7.5/20.0% in the WLC. Additionally, we found a greater reduction in general eating disorder psychopathology, of food consumption in a bogus taste test and of depression in the ER skills training condition. Moreover, the greater reduction in binge-eating episodes in the training condition was (partially) mediated by a greater increase in ER skills. Conclusions The findings provide further support for the assumed importance of deficits in ER as a maintaining factor and, hence, as a target in the treatment of BED. As ER skills trainings have been shown to also reduce other kinds of psychopathology, they might be considered a promising transdiagnostic add-on component to disorder-specific interventions.",

Previous research is unclear about whether such differences exist and, if so, how they may be explained. The meta-analyses revealed substantial age-related differences. Older adults gave larger verbal estimates and made shorter productions of duration than did younger adults. There were no age-related differences in reproduction of duration or in psychophysical slope relating judged and target duration. Older adults‚Äô duration estimates were more variable than were those of younger ones. Findings are discussed in terms of pacemaker rate and attentional resources. An explanation regarding divided attention between nontemporal and temporal information processing best explains the findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

In den vergangenen vierzig Jahren hat sich das Scheidungsrisiko mehr als verdoppelt. Und inzwischen betrifft diese hohe Scheidungsrate auch immer mehr langj√§hrige Ehen. Trotzdem haben Ehe und Partnerschaft nicht an Bedeutung verloren: die meisten Menschen verheiraten sich im Laufe ihres Lebens und auch nach einer Scheidung besteht weiterhin der starke Wunsch nach einer Ehe oder stabilen Partnerschaft. Der renommierte Psychologe und Paar- und Familientherapeut Guy Bodenmann zeigt in seinem Lehrbuch: ¬∑ die Bedeutung der Familie und Partnerschaft bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von psychischen St√∂rungen ¬∑ dass ein individuumzentriertes St√∂rungsverst√§ndnis bei Kindern, Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen zu kurz greift ¬∑ aber nicht nur die sch√§dlichen Auswirkungen von dysfunktionalen Strukturen, sondern auch die noch weitgehend ungenutzen Ressourcen zur Heilung, die sich in Partnerschaften und Familien bieten.",

            "abstract": "Modern nosologies (e.g., International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition [ICD-11], Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition [DSM‚Äì5]) for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and dependence prioritize reliability and clinical presentation over etiology, resulting in a diagnosis that is not always strongly grounded in basic theory and research. Within these nosologies, DSM‚Äì5 AUD is treated as a discrete, largely categorical, but graded, phenomenon, which results in additional challenges (e.g., significant phenotypic heterogeneity). Efforts to increase the compatibility between AUD diagnosis and modern conceptualizations of alcohol dependence, which describe it as dimensional and partially overlapping with other psychopathology (e.g., other substance use disorders), will inspire a stronger scientific framework and strengthen AUD‚Äôs validity. We conducted a systematic review of 144 reviews to integrate addiction constructs and theories into a comprehensive framework to identify fundamental mechanisms implicated in AUD. The product of this effort was the Etiologic, Theory-based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical Framework (ETOH Framework) of AUD mechanisms, which outlines superdomains of cognitive control, reward, and negative valence and emotionality, each of which subsume narrower, hierarchically organized components. We also outline opponent processes and self-awareness as key moderators of AUD mechanisms. In contrast with other frameworks, we recommend an increased conceptual role for negative valence and compulsion in AUD. The ETOH framework serves as a critical step toward conceptualizations of AUD as dimensional and heterogeneous. It has the potential to improve AUD assessment and aid in the development of evidence-based diagnostic measures that focus on key mechanisms in AUD, consequently facilitating precision medicine.

            "abstract": "Precision medicine has been advanced as a potential solution to the problem of alcohol use disorder heterogeneity and modest alcohol use disorder treatment efficacy. The success of precision medicine lies in our ability to first identify the etiologic and maintenance mechanisms at play for a given person and then choose the treatment that is most likely to address such mechanisms. There exist several frameworks that describe empirically supported substance use disorder (SUD) etiologic and maintenance mechanisms (e.g., the Etiologic, Theory-based, Ontogenetic, Hierarchical [ETOH] Framework). There also exists a large literature on mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorder treatment. However, the mechanism of behavior change literature on alcohol use disorder treatments has focused broadly on mechanisms of change rather than more specifically on core alcohol use disorder etiologic and maintenance mechanisms. Thus, the two types of mechanisms have never been integrated or systematically evaluated for their overlap. As such, the aim of the present brief review is to demonstrate how commonly used alcohol use disorder treatments may overlap with and directly target certain alcohol use disorder etiologic and maintenance mechanisms (specifically those described by the ETOH framework). We delineate empirically plausible overlapping mechanisms and theoretically plausible overlapping mechanisms that warrant more research. Last, based on the identification of empirically and theoretically plausible overlapping mechanisms, we elaborate on how ongoing work related to alcohol use disorder precision medicine may test specific hypotheses regarding which treatments work best for whom.

            "abstract": "In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett‚Äôs (1987) notion of real patterns, and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops. This suggests that neither psychological nor biological levels can claim causal or explanatory priority, and that a holistic research strategy is necessary for progress in the study of mental disorders.",

            "abstract": "This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.",

            "abstract": "There has been considerable debate and concern as to whether there is a replication crisis in the scientific literature. A likely cause of poor replication is the multiple comparisons problem. An important way in which this problem can manifest in the M/EEG context is through post hoc tailoring of analysis windows (a.k.a. regions-of-interest, ROIs) to landmarks in the collected data. Post hoc tailoring of ROIs is used because it allows researchers to adapt to inter-experiment variability and discover novel differences that fall outside of windows defined by prior precedent, thereby reducing Type II errors. However, this approach can dramatically inflate Type I error rates. One way to avoid this problem is to tailor windows according to a contrast that is orthogonal (strictly parametrically orthogonal) to the contrast being tested. A key approach of this kind is to identify windows on a fully flattened average. On the basis of simulations, this approach has been argued to be safe for post hoc tailoring of analysis windows under many conditions. Here, we present further simulations and mathematical proofs to show exactly why the Fully Flattened Average approach is unbiased, providing a formal grounding to the approach, clarifying the limits of its applicability and resolving published misconceptions about the method. We also provide a statistical power analysis, which shows that, in specific contexts, the fully flattened average approach provides higher statistical power than Fieldtrip cluster inference. This suggests that the Fully Flattened Average approach will enable researchers to identify more effects from their data without incurring an inflation of the false positive rate.",

            "abstract": "Significance Twitter and other social media platforms are believed to have altered the course of numerous historical events, from the Arab Spring to the US presidential election. Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion. , Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call ‚Äúmoral contagion.‚Äù Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues ( n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.",

            "abstract": "Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.",

            "abstract": "One particular weakness of psychology that was left implicit by Meehl is the fact that psychological theories tend to be verbal theories, permitting at best ordinal predictions. Such predictions do not enable the high-risk tests that would strengthen our belief in the verisimilitude of theories but instead lead to the practice of null-hypothesis significance testing, a practice Meehl believed to be a major reason for the slow theoretical progress of soft psychology. The rising popularity of meta-analysis has led some to argue that we should move away from significance testing and focus on the size and stability of effects instead. Proponents of this reform assume that a greater emphasis on quantity can help psychology to develop a cumulative body of knowledge. The crucial question in this endeavor is whether the resulting numbers really have theoretical meaning. Psychological science lacks an undisputed, preexisting domain of observations analogous to the observations in the space-time continuum in physics. It is argued that, for this reason, effect sizes do not really exist independently of the adopted research design that led to their manifestation. Consequently, they can have no bearing on the verisimilitude of a theory.",

            "abstract": "There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of research studies employing event-related potential (ERP) techniques to examine dynamic and rapidly-occurring neural processes with children during the preschool and early childhood years. Despite this, there has been little discussion of the methodological and procedural differences that exist for studies of young children versus older children and adults. That is, reviewers, editors, and consumers of this work often expect developmental studies to simply apply adult techniques and procedures to younger samples. Procedurally, this creates unrealistic expectations for research paradigms, data collection, and data reduction and analyses. Scientifically, this leads to inappropriate measures and methods that hinder drawing conclusions and advancing theory. Based on ERP work with preschoolers and young children from 10 laboratories across North America, we present a summary of the most common ERP components under study in the area of emotion and cognition in young children along with 13 realistic expectations for data collection and loss, laboratory procedures and paradigms, data processing, ERP averaging, and typical challenges for conducting this type of work. This work is intended to supplement previous guidelines for work with adults and offer insights to aid researchers, reviewers, and editors in the design and evaluation of developmental research using ERPs. Here we make recommendations for researchers who plan to conduct or who are conducting ERP studies in children between ages 2 and 12, focusing on studies of toddlers and preschoolers.

            "abstract": "In ERP and other large multidimensional neuroscience data sets, researchers often select regions of interest (ROIs) for analysis. The method of ROI selection can critically affect the conclusions of a study by causing the researcher to miss effects in the data or to detect spurious effects. In practice, to avoid inflating Type I error rate (i.e., false positives), ROIs are often based on a priori hypotheses or independent information. However, this can be insensitive to experiment-specific variations in effect location (e.g., latency shifts) reducing power to detect effects. Data-driven ROI selection, in contrast, is nonindependent and uses the data under analysis to determine ROI positions. Therefore, it has potential to select ROIs based on experiment-specific information and increase power for detecting effects. However, data-driven methods have been criticized because they can substantially inflate Type I error rate. Here, we demonstrate, using simulations of simple ERP experiments, that data-driven ROI selection can indeed be more powerful than a priori hypotheses or independent information. Furthermore, we show that data-driven ROI selection using the aggregate grand average from trials (AGAT), despite being based on the data at hand, can be safely used for ROI selection under many circumstances. However, when there is a noise difference between conditions, using the AGAT can inflate Type I error and should be avoided. We identify critical assumptions for use of the AGAT and provide a basis for researchers to use, and reviewers to assess, data-driven methods of ROI localization in ERP and other studies.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that measures of reasoning ability and of working memory capacity (WMC) correlate positively. However, the question of what explains this relationship remains open. The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity hypothesis, which ascribes causality to WMC. This hypothesis holds that people high in WMC are more successful in capacity-demanding cognitive tasks than people lower in WMC because they can temporarily maintain more information in the form of sub-goals, hypotheses, and partial solutions. Accordingly, this hypothesis predicts that the correlation between WMC and reasoning performance should increase as the capacity demands of the reasoning items increase. We tested this prediction using items from Raven‚Äôs Progressive Matrices and two measures of WMC, complex span and the k estimate from the Visual Arrays task. Neither WMC measure showed the effect predicted by the capacity hypothesis. Furthermore, the results cannot be attributed to restriction of range in performance on the individual reasoning items. This finding adds to existing evidence calling into question the capacity hypothesis, and, more generally, the view that WMC has a causal influence on fluid intelligence.",

Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological principles.",

            "abstract": "The subjective sense of future time plays an essential role in human motivation. Gradually, time left becomes a better predictor than chronological age for a range of cognitive, emotional, and motivational variables. Socioemotional selectivity theory maintains that constraints on time horizons shift motivational priorities in such a way that the regulation of emotional states becomes more important than other types of goals. This motivational shift occurs with age but also appears in other contexts (for example, geographical relocations, illnesses, and war) that limit subjective future time.",

            "abstract": "Alcohol use increased in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area in the first months after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Aims: To investigate alcohol use trajectories in the NYC metropolitan area in the 3 years after 11 September and examine the relative contributions of acute exposure to the attacks and ongoing stressors to these trajectories. Design: We used a population-based cohort of adults recruited through a random-digit-dial telephone survey in 2002; participants completed three follow-up interviews over 30 months. Setting The NYC metropolitan area. Participants: A total of 2752 non-institutionalized adult residents of NYC. Measurements: We used growth mixture models to assess trajectories in levels of total alcohol consumption and bingeing in the past 30 days, and predictors of these trajectories. Findings: We identified five trajectories of alcohol consumption levels and three bingeing trajectories. Predictors of higher levels of use over time included ongoing stressors, traumatic events and lower income. Ongoing exposure to stressors and low income also play a central role in bingeing trajectories. Conclusions: While point-in-time mass traumatic events may matter in the short term, their contribution subsides over time. Accumulated stressors and traumatic events, in contrast, lead to higher levels of consumption among respondents already vulnerable to high alcohol use. Interventions to mitigate post-disaster stressors may have substantial benefit in reducing alcohol abuse in the medium- to long term. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Go/Nogo tasks, in which subjects are instructed to respond to a certain type of stimuli (Go) and withhold responses to other types of predefined stimuli (Nogo), have been extensively employed to study the age-related alterations of cognitive inhibition. However, it remains inconclusive whether the N2 and P3 electrophysiological responses to successful inhibition to Nogo stimuli are affected by aging processes. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of Go/Nogo studies to investigate the age effect on Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 activities as well as behavioral performance of commission errors. The potential moderators regarding different probabilities of Nogo trials and levels of task difficulty on the effect sizes were also assessed. There were no significant age-related differences in commission errors. However, compared to the younger group, the elderly demonstrated reduced Nogo-N2 amplitudes, particularly in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50%. Furthermore, age-related reduction of Nogo-P3 amplitudes and prolongation of Nogo-P3 latencies were observed in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50%. In conclusion, our data suggest that despite similar behavioral performance in the younger and older adults, neural processing of response inhibition becomes inefficient with advancing age.",

            "abstract": "While inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis is a powerful tool for naturalistic scanning data, drawing appropriate statistical inferences is difficult due to the daunting task of accounting for the intricate relatedness in data structure as well as handling the multiple testing issue. Although the linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling approach (Chen et¬†al., 2017a) is capable of capturing the relatedness in the data and incorporating explanatory variables, there are a few challenging issues: 1) it is difficult to assign accurate degrees of freedom for each testing statistic, 2) multiple testing correction is potentially over-penalizing due to model inefficiency, and 3) thresholding necessitates arbitrary dichotomous decisions. Here we propose a Bayesian multilevel (BML) framework for ISC data analysis that integrates all regions of interest into one model. By loosely constraining the regions through a weakly informative prior, BML dissolves multiplicity through conservatively pooling the effect of each region toward the center and improves collective fitting and overall model performance. In addition to potentially achieving a higher inference efficiency, BML improves spatial specificity and easily allows the investigator to adopt a philosophy of full results reporting. A dataset of naturalistic scanning is utilized to illustrate the modeling approach with 268 parcels and to showcase the modeling capability, flexibility and advantages in results reporting. The associated program will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.",

            "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has been instrumental in making discoveries about cognition, brain function, and dysfunction. However, where do EEG signals come from and what do they mean? The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers. Neural oscillations are perhaps the best feature of EEG to use as anchors because oscillations are observed and are studied at multiple spatiotemporal scales of the brain, in multiple species, and are widely implicated in cognition and in neural computations.",

            "abstract": "We all have a sense of time. Yet, there are no sensory receptors specifically dedicated for perceiving time. It is an almost uniquely intangible sensation: we cannot see time in the way that we see color, shape, or even location. So how is time represented in the brain? We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia (BG), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the BG and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory‚Äìinhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision.",

Younger and older adults performed a perceptual judgment task at five levels of complexity for periods of 30, 60, and 120 sec. Participants either continued to perform the task for a specified interval (production) or were stopped and then verbally estimated the interval. Older adults gave shorter verbal estimates and longer productions than did younger adults. The methods of verbal estimation and production yielded approximately equal duration judgment ratios once range effects were taken into account. Task complexity had little effect. The major conclusion is that duration judgment ratios decrease from younger to older adults when the intervals are filled with a mental task.",

            "abstract": "There has been a substantial growth in empirical research aimed at examining the co-occurrence of alexithymia and problematic alcohol use and alcohol use disorder (AUD) since Thorberg, Young, Sullivan, and Lyvers (2009) original review article. The objective of the present paper is therefore to provide a critical update review of research on alexithymia and problematic alcohol use published since 2009. A systematic search was conducted through PsychINFO, Medline, and ProQuest databases to obtain relevant literature published between 2009 and 2016. Studies that involved measures of alexithymia and problematic alcohol use among clinical and non-clinical samples were included. Prevalence rates of alexithymia among Alcohol Dependent (AD) samples were identified between 30 and 49%, and were therefore much lower than originally reported. The findings of this update review highlight an indirect relationship between alexithymia and alcohol problem severity that is mediated by a number of psychological drinking constructs (e.g., alcohol expectancy, drinking motives, craving and alcohol related intrusive thoughts) and psychological risk factors for the development of alcohol related problems (e.g., mood and emotion dysregulation, attachment, trauma, and cognitive function). In addition, this review provides reasonable evidence to support alexithymia as an independent risk factor for alcohol related problems among clinical samples only. In conclusion, alexithymia is a multifaceted construct that has a complex relationship with various risk factors and psychological drinking constructs. The growing body of research highlights the demand for understanding the interrelationships between alexithymia, psychosocial risk factors, and problematic alcohol use in order to tailor and target therapeutic interventions.",

            "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Evidence suggests that ASD patients have abnormalities in information processing. Event-related potential (ERP) technique can directly record brain neural activity in real time. P300 is a positive ERP component which can measure the neuroelectrophysiological characteristics of human beings and has the potential to discover the pathological mechanism of ASD. However, P300 studies on ASD patients are incongruent and the disparities may be caused by several factors. By searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, a meta-analysis of P300 component difference between ASD group and typically developed (TD) control group was conducted. Results of amplitude and latency of P3b and P3a from included studies were synthesized. Random effect model was chosen and standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to identify the source of heterogeneity and to test the effect of different experiment factors. A total of 407 ASD patients and 457 TD controls from 32 studies were included in this analysis. Reduced amplitude of P3b was found in ASD group (SMD = ‚àí0.505, 95 % CI ‚àí0.873, ‚àí0.138) compared with TD group, but no difference of P3b latency, P3a amplitude, or P3a latency was found between groups. Subgroup analysis showed that oddball paradigm elicited attenuated P3b amplitude in Pz electrode among ASD subjects. This meta-analysis suggests ASD patients have abnormalities in P300 component, which may represent for deficits in cognition, attention orientation and working memory processing, particularly in the decision-making processing condition.

Running through these papers are a pair of themes: that explaining the mind requires functional analysis, not subsumption under \"psychological laws\", and that the propositional attitudes‚Äìbelief, desire, intention‚Äìand their interactions, while real, are not the key to understanding the mind at a fundamental level. Taking these ideas seriously puts considerable strain on standard conceptions of rationality and reasoning, on truth-conditional semantics, and on our interpretation of experimental evidence concerning cognitive development, learning and the evolution of mental traits and processes. The temptation to read the structure of mental states and their interactions off the structure of human language is powerful and seductive, but has created a widening gap between what most philosophers and social scientists take for granted about the mind, and the framework we need to make sense what an accelerating biology and neuroscience are telling us about brains. The challenge for the philosophy of mind is to devise a framework that accommodates these developments. This is the underlying motivation for the papers in this collection",

These models describe behavioral data in terms of underlying, latent variables linked to hypothesized cognitive processes. A goal of model-based cognitive neuroscience is to link these variables to brain measurements, which can advance progress in both cognitive and neuroscientific research. However, the details and the philosophical approach for this linking problem can vary greatly. We propose a continuum of approaches that differ in the degree of tight, quantitative, and explicit hypothesizing. We describe this continuum using four points along it, which we dub qualitative structural, qualitative predictive, quantitative predictive, and single model linking approaches. We further illustrate by providing examples from three research fields (decision making, reinforcement learning, and symbolic reasoning) for the different linking approaches.",

            "abstract": "Aggressive and antisocial behaviors are detrimental to society and constitute major challenges in forensic mental health settings, yet the associated neural circuitry remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated differences in aggressive and antisocial behaviors between healthy controls (n¬†=¬†20) and violent mentally disordered offenders (MDOs; n¬†=¬†26), and examined associations between aggressive and antisocial behaviors, behavioral inhibitory control, and neurophysiological activity across the whole sample (n¬†=¬†46). Event-related potentials were obtained using EEG while participants completed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task, and aggressive and antisocial behaviors were assessed with the Life History of Aggression (LHA) instrument. Using a robust Bayesian linear regression approach, we found that MDOs scored substantially higher than healthy controls on LHA Aggression and Antisocial subscales. Using the whole sample and after adjusting for age, we found that scores on the LHA Aggression and Antisocial subscales were robustly associated with longer NoGo P3 latency, and less robustly with longer NoGo N2 latency. Post-hoc analyzes suggested that healthy controls and MDOs exhibited similar associations. With several limitations in mind, we suggest that prolonged NoGo P3 latency, reflecting decreased neural efficiency during the later stages of conflict monitoring or outcome evaluation, is a potential neurobehavioral correlate of aggressive and antisocial behaviors.",

            "abstract": "Backgroud With the advent of modern computing methods, modeling trial-to-trial variability in biophysical recordings including electroencephalography (EEG) has become of increasingly interest. Yet no widely used method exists for comparing variability in ordered collections of single-trial data epochs across conditions and subjects. New method We have developed a method based on an ERP-image visualization tool in which potential, spectral power, or some other measure at each time point in a set of event-related single-trial data epochs are represented as color coded horizontal lines that are then stacked to form a 2-D colored image. Moving-window smoothing across trial epochs can make otherwise hidden event-related features in the data more perceptible. Stacking trials in different orders, for example ordered by subject reaction time, by context-related information such as inter-stimulus interval, or some other characteristic of the data (e.g., latency-window mean power or phase of some EEG source) can reveal aspects of the multifold complexities of trial-to-trial EEG data variability. Results This study demonstrates new methods for computing and visualizing ‚Äúgrand‚Äù ERP-image plots across subjects and for performing robust statistical testing on the resulting images. These methods have been implemented and made freely available in the EEGLAB signal-processing environment that we maintain and distribute.",

It is known that an individual‚Äôs viewing behavior, reflected in their eye movements, is directly related to attentional mechanisms and higher-order cognitive processes. We therefore explore whether ADHD can be detected based on recorded eye movements together with information about the video stimulus in a free-viewing task. To this end, we develop an end-to-end deep learning-based sequence model which we pre-train on a related task for which more data are available. We find that the method is in fact able to detect ADHD and outperforms relevant baselines. We investigate the relevance of the input features in an ablation study. Interestingly, we find that the model‚Äôs performance is closely related to the content of the video, which provides insights for future experimental designs.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of linguistic patterns has been object of extensive debate in research programs focused on probing the inherent structure of human language abilities. But in what sense is a linguistic phenomenon more complex than another, and what can complexity tell us about the connection between linguistic typology and human cognition? This chapter approaches these questions by presenting a broad and informal introduction to the vast literature on formal language theory, computational learning theory, and artificial grammar learning. In doing so, it hopes to provide readers with an understanding of the relevance of mathematically grounded approaches to cognitive investigations into linguistic complexity, and thus further fruitful collaborations between cognitive scientists and mathematically inclined linguist and psychologist.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, researchers have used various methodologies to assess different forms of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and their influence on alcohol consumption. Contrasting results between clinical and general populations were observed. To summarize the current literature on RNT and alcohol use, a systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). Among the 27 included studies, the seven conducted among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the three focusing on other adult samples demonstrated a strong positive association between RNT and alcohol use or alcohol-related problems, regardless of the form of RNT. The results were more heterogeneous in the 17 studies conducted among adolescents and students, leading the authors to conclude that the results varied as a function of the severity of alcohol use. The results of this study suggest to focus on RNT from a transdiagnostic perspective in AUD. This processual approach may improve AUD treatment and relapse prevention. Finally, some gaps in the literature must be addressed: (1) the gender differences in the link between RNT and alcohol use and (2) the specific influence of RNT on alcohol use among young adults.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a fundamental procedure for event-related potential (ERP) research and yet there is very little guidance for best practices. It is important for the field to develop evidence-based best practices: 1) to minimize the Type II error rate by maximizing statistical power, 2) to minimize the Type I error rate by reducing the latitude for varying procedures, and 3) to identify areas for further methodological improvements. While generic treatments of ANOVA methodology are available, ERP datasets have many unique characteristics that must be considered. In the present report, a novelty oddball dataset was utilized as a test case to determine whether three aspects of ANOVA procedures as applied to ERPs make a real-world difference: the effects of reference site, regional channels, and robust ANOVAs. Recommendations are provided for best practices in each of these areas.",

            "abstract": "Inference using significance testing and Bayes factors is compared and contrasted in five case studies based on real research. The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intuitions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-significant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, conversely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be evidentially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.",

Recent studies using standardized emotional material provide a unique opportunity for understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the effects of emotion on timing and time perception in the milliseconds-to-hours range. We outline how these new findings can be explained within the framework of internal-clock models and describe how emotional arousal and valence interact to produce both increases and decreases in attentional time sharing and clock speed. The study of time and emotion is at a crossroads, and we outline possible examples for future directions.",

            "abstract": "One of the original aims of this journal was to promote theory in psychology. Nowadays more and more psychological researchers are calling for more theory development, and articles on the ‚Äútheory crisis‚Äù have also found their way into mainstream journals. In this article, we provide a further perspective to this theory debate. Over the past century, philosophy of science has staged extensive discussions on the mathematization of nature and on the role of mathematics in the development of theory and the connection of theory to empirical facts. We show that these discussions are highly relevant for the current debate in psychology. In particular, we emphasize the importance of conceptual work in the process of mathematization, and the role of mathematics in co-ordinating theory and observations. We then discuss the implications that these points have for statistically oriented psychology in general and for the recent theory debate in psychology.",

            "abstract": "Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On the one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This paper gives overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasize on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogenous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data cannot be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.",

            "abstract": "ERP studies produce large spatiotemporal data sets. These rich data sets are key to enabling us to understand cognitive and neural processes. However, they also present a massive multiple comparisons problem, potentially leading to a large number of studies with false positive effects (a high Type I error rate). Standard approaches to ERP statistical analysis, which average over time windows and regions of interest, do not always control for Type I error, and their inflexibility can lead to low power to detect true effects. Mass univariate approaches offer an alternative analytic method. However, they have thus far been viewed as appropriate primarily for exploratory statistical analysis and only applicable to simple designs. Here, we present new simulation studies showing that permutation-based mass univariate tests can be employed with complex factorial designs. Most importantly, we show that mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power than traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches when strong a priori time windows and spatial regions are used. Moreover, their power decreases only modestly when more exploratory spatiotemporal parameters are used. We argue that mass univariate approaches are preferable to traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches for many ERP studies.",

            "abstract": "The role of the hippocampus in P300 has long been debated. Here, we present a theoretical framework that elucidates hippocampal contributions to scalp P300 based on intracranial and lesion research combined with emerging evidence on the role of the hippocampus in rapid statistical learning, memory, and novelty processing. The P300 has been divided in two subcomponents: a fronto-central P3a related to novelty and distractor processing, and a parietal P3b related to target detection. Interest in a role for hippocampus in scalp P300 was sparked by P3-like ERPs measured intracranially in human hippocampus. Subsequent medial temporal lobe lesion studies show intact scalp P3b, indicating that the hippocampus is not critical for P3b. This contrasts with the scalp P3a, which was significantly diminished in human patients with lesions in the posterior hippocampus. This suggests a differential role for hippocampus in P3a and P3b. Our framework purports that the hippocampus plays a central role in distractor processing that leads to P3a generation in cortical regions. We also propose that the hippocampus is involved at the end of the cognitive episode for both P3a and P3b implementing contextual updating. P3-like ERPs measured in hippocampus may reflect input signals from cortical regions implementing updates based on the outcome of cognitive processes underlying scalp P3, enabling a model update of the environment facilitated by the hippocampus. Overall, this framework proposes an active role for the hippocampus in novelty processing leading up to P3a generation, followed by contextual updating of the outcome of both scalp P3a and P3b.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscientists study how the brain implements particular cognitive processes such as perception, learning, and decision-making. Traditional approaches in which experiments are designed to target a specific cognitive process have been supplemented by two recent innovations. First, formal cognitive models can decompose observed behavioral data into multiple latent cognitive processes, allowing brain measurements to be associated with a particular cognitive process more precisely and more confidently. Second, cognitive neuroscience can provide additional data to inform the development of formal cognitive models, providing greater constraint than behavioral data alone. We argue that these fields are mutually dependent; not only can models guide neuroscientific endeavors, but understanding neural mechanisms can provide key insights into formal models of cognition.",

We then summarize the alternate theoretical formulations that have been advanced to address these anomalies.

Throughout the paper, we stress the importance of distinguishing time preference, per se, from many other considerations that also influence intertemporal choices.",

            "abstract": "Information search is key to making decision from experience: exploration permits people to learn about the statistical properties of choice options and thus to become aware of rare but potentially momentous decision consequences. This registered report investigates whether and how people differ when making decisions from experience in isolation versus under competitive pressure, which may have important implications for choice performance in different types of choice environments: in ‚Äúkind‚Äù environments without any rare and extreme events, frugal search is sufficient to identify advantageous options. Conversely, in ‚Äúwicked‚Äù environments with skewed outcome distributions, rare but important events will tend to be missed in frugal search. One theoretical view is that competitive pressure encourages efficiency and may thereby boost adaptive search in different environments. An alternative and more pessimistic view is that competitive pressure triggers agency-related concerns, leading to minimal search irrespective of the choice environment, and hence to inferior choice performance. Using a sampling game, the present study ( = 277) found that solitary search was not adaptive to different choice environments ( = 14 samples), leading to a high choice performance in a kind and in a moderately wicked environment, but somewhat lower performance in an extremely wicked environment. Competitive pressure substantially reduced search irrespective of the choice environment ( = 4 samples), thus negatively affecting overall choice performance. Yet, from the perspective of a cost-benefit framework, frugal search may be efficient under competitive pressure. In sum, this report extends research on decisions from experience by adopting an ecological perspective (i.e., systematically varying different choice environments) and by introducing a cost-benefit framework to evaluate solitary and competitive search ‚Äî with the latter constituting a challenging problem for people in an increasingly connected world.",

            "abstract": "People‚Äôs risk preferences are thought to be central to many consequential real-life decisions, making it important to identify robust correlates of this construct. Various psychological theories have put forth a series of candidate correlates, yet the strength and robustness of their associations remain unclear because of disparate operationalizations of risk preference and analytic limitations in past research. We addressed these issues with a study involving several operationalizations of risk preference (all collected from each participant in a diverse sample of the German population; N œ≠ 916), and by adopting an exhaustive modeling approach‚Äîspecification curve analysis. Our analyses of 6 candidate correlates (household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, years of education) suggest that sex and age have robust and consistent associations with risk preference, whereas the other candidate correlates show weaker and more (domain-) specific associations (except for crystallized intelligence, for which there were no robust associations). The results further demonstrate the important role of construct operationalization when assessing people‚Äôs risk preferences: Self-reported propensity measures picked up various associations with the proposed correlates, but (incentivized) behavioral measures largely failed to do so. In short, the associations between the 6 candidate correlates and risk preference depend mostly on how risk preference is measured, rather than whether and which control variables are included in the model specifications. The present findings inform several theories that have suggested candidate correlates of risk preference, and illustrate how personality research may profit from exhaustive modeling techniques to improve theory and measurement of essential constructs.",

A wide variety of evidence suggests that the MMN reflects the detection of deviant events, whereas the P3a is associated more with the evaluation of those events for subsequent behavioral action. On the scalp, the novelty P3a is comprised of at least two aspects, one frontal the other posterior, each with different cognitive (and presumably neurologic) correlates. Intracranial ERP investigations and studies of patients with localized brain lesions (and, to some extent, fMRI data) converge with the scalp-recorded data in suggesting a widespread neural network, the different aspects of which respond differentially to stimulus and task characteristics.",

The capacity hypothesis states that this relationship is due to limitations in the amount of information that can be stored and held active in working memory. Previous research aimed at testing the capacity hypothesis assumed that it implies stronger relationships of intelligence test performance with WMC for test items with higher capacity demands. The present article addresses this assumption through simulations of three theoretical models implementing the capacity hypothesis while systematically varying different psychometric variables. The results show that almost any relation between the capacity demands of items and their correlation with WMC can be obtained. Therefore, the assumption made by previous studies does not hold: The capacity hypothesis does not imply stronger correlations of WMC and intelligence test items with higher capacity demands. Items varying in capacity demands cannot be used to test the causality of WMC (or any other latent variable) for fluid intelligence.",

            "abstract": "Here we present an application of an EEG processing pipeline customizing EEGLAB and FieldTrip functions, specifically optimized to flexibly analyze EEG data based on single trial information. The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g., performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.",

            "abstract": "Background: In this study, psychosocial functioning of different groups of young children with learning problems was investigated using a diverse set of psychosocial variables (including behaviour problems, academic motivation, social preference, and self-concept). Methods: For this purpose, children with low academic achievement, with a specific learning disability based on an IQ‚Äìachievement discrepancy, and with a specific learning disability based on an achievement discrepancy, were selected out of 276 children of the first grade of regular primary schools. By means of multivariate analyses, their psychosocial functioning was compared to the functioning of children without learning problems. Results: The total set of psychosocial variables was able to discriminate between children with and without learning problems, with medium effect size. Attention problems as reported by the teachers turned out to be the most important single psychosocial predictor for group discrimination. However, results varied according to the type of learning problem and the type of psychosocial problem. Children with a specific reading/spelling disability and children with low general academic achievement differed most from their peers without learning problems with regard to their psychosocial functioning. Poor cognitive self-concept was related primarily to low academic achievement, poor learning motivation might be specific for math problems, and a low social preference score seemed most characteristic of children with a specific learning disability. Conclusions: Studying several psychosocial variables simultaneously in different groups of children with learning problems leads to a further refinement of the current knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Surprisingly little scientific research has been conducted on the topic of interpersonal touch over the years, despite the importance of touch in our everyday social interactions from birth through to adulthood and old age. In this review, we critically evaluate the results of the research on this topic that have emerged from disciplines, such as cognitive and social psychology, neuroscience, and cultural anthropology. We highlight some of the most important advances to have been made in our understanding of this topic: For example, research has shown that interpersonal tactile stimulation provides an effective means of influencing people‚Äôs social behaviors (such as modulating their tendency to comply with requests, in affecting people‚Äôs attitudes toward specific services, in creating bonds between couples or groups, and in strengthening romantic relationships), regardless of whether or not the tactile contact itself can be remembered explicitly. What is more, interpersonal touch can be used to communicate emotion in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously in vision and audition. The recent growth of studies investigating the potential introduction of tactile sensations to long-distance communication technologies (by means of mediated or ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù touch) are also reviewed briefly. Finally, we highlight the synergistic effort that will be needed by researchers in different disciplines if we are to develop a more complete understanding of interpersonal touch in the years to come.",

            "abstract": "Differences in reading repeated/new words in adults are known to be reflected in the N400 and P600 components of event-related potentials (ERP), though the question of the functional significance of these components in the age-related trajectory of their development remains open. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amplitudes and latencies of the N400 and P600 components in responses to repeated and new words in three age groups: preadolescent children (N = 25; age 9‚Äì11 years), adolescents (N = 17, age 12‚Äì14 years), and adults (N = 22, age 18‚Äì36 years). Age-related differences in amplitudes were seen for the N400 component averaged for leads F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, and C4 and the P600 component averaged for leads P3, Pz, and P4, while no differences in latency were seen. Comparison of the amplitudes of averaged ERP to repeated and new words identified differences in all age groups: in children in the time interval 750‚Äì850 msec, in adolescents in the time interval 650‚Äì750 msec, and in adults in the interval 600‚Äì800 msec. P600 amplitude in all age groups was greater in responses to repeated than to new words. In the case of N400, differences in responses to repeated and new words were seen only among adults, where latency to new words was shorter than latency to repeated words. The process of comparing new and previously presented verbal and visual information is evidently a multistage process. These stages are formed at different points of ontogeny and are reflected to different extents in the various ERP components. Differences between repeated and new words initially appeared in the P600 component: the pattern of differences at age 12‚Äì14 years was analogous to that in adults. At the same time, there were no differences in the N400 component in childhood and adolescence, these being present only in adults.",

            "abstract": "Prior findings on P3 event-related potential deficits in antisocial populations are mixed and it has been suggested that these abnormalities may not apply to psychopaths. A meta-analysis of 38 studies (total N=2616) was conducted to investigate the relationship of P3 measures to antisocial behavior. Reduced P3 amplitudes (d=0.252, p<.001) and longer P3 latencies (d=0.130, p=.019) were significantly associated with antisocial behavior across all electrode sites, and when using both normal and non-normal control groups. A significant moderating effect of electrode site indicated longer latencies at Fz but not Pz. Compared to non-psychopathic offenders, psychopathic offenders showed P3 amplitudes impairments in standard oddball tasks, but not other tasks. Findings suggest that reduced P3 amplitudes and prolonged P3 latencies may reflect inefficient deployment of neural resources in processing cognitive task-relevant information in individuals characterized with generic antisocial behavior (i.e., aggression, antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder/oppositional-defiant disorder, and psychopathy), whereas this association in psychopaths may be moderated by the type of tasks.",

Rituals are indispensable for identification with social groups, but they should be the subject rather than the procedure of science. What I call the ‚Äúnull ritual‚Äù consists of three steps: (1) set up a statistical null hypothesis, but do not specify your own hypothesis nor any alternative hypothesis, (2) use the 5% significance level for rejecting the null and accepting your hypothesis, and (3) always perform this procedure.

            "abstract": "Background Prevalences of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and Mental Health Disorders (MHDs) in many individual countries have been reported but there are few cross-national studies. The WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative standardizes methodological factors facilitating comparison of the prevalences and associated factors of AUDs in a large number of countries to identify differences and commonalities. Methods Lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of DSM-IV AUDs, MHDs, and associations were assessed in the 29 WMH surveys using the WHO CIDI 3.0. Results Prevalence estimates of alcohol use and AUD across countries and WHO regions varied widely. Mean lifetime prevalence of alcohol use in all countries combined was 80%, ranging from 3.8% to 97.1%. Combined average population lifetime and 12-month prevalence of AUDs were 8.6% and 2.2% respectively and 10.7% and 4.4% among non-abstainers. Of individuals with a lifetime AUD, 43.9% had at least one lifetime MHD and 17.9% of respondents with a lifetime MHD had a lifetime AUD. For most comorbidity combinations, the MHD preceded the onset of the AUD. AUD prevalence was much higher for men than women. 15% of all lifetime AUD cases developed before age 18. Higher household income and being older at time of interview, married, and more educated, were associated with a lower risk for lifetime AUD and AUD persistence. Conclusions Prevalence of alcohol use and AUD is high overall, with large variation worldwide. The WMH surveys corroborate the wide geographic consistency of a number of well-documented clinical and epidemiological findings and patterns.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Although several risk factors have been identified for alcohol use disorder, many individuals with these factors do not go on to develop the disorder. Identifying early phenotypic differences between vulnerable individuals and healthy control subjects could help identify those at higher risk. Binge drinking, defined as reaching a blood alcohol level of 80 mg%, carries a risk of negative legal and health outcomes and may be an early marker of vulnerability. Using a carefully controlled experimental paradigm, the authors tested the hypothesis that risk factors for alcohol use disorder, including family history of alcoholism, male sex, impulsivity, and low level of response to alcohol, would predict rate of binging during an individual alcohol consumption session. Method: This cross-sectional study included 159 young social drinkers who completed a laboratory session in which they self-administered alcohol intravenously. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether risk factors for alcohol use disorder were associated with the rate of achieving a binge-level exposure. Results: A greater percentage of relatives with alcoholism (hazard ratio: 1.04, 95% CI=1.02‚Äì1.07), male sex (hazard ratio: 1.74, 95% CI=1.03‚Äì2.93), and higher impulsivity (hazard ratio: 1.17, 95% CI=1.00 to 1.37) were associated with a higher rate of binging throughout the session. Participants with all three risk factors had the highest rate of binging throughout the session compared with the lowest risk group (hazard ratio: 5.27, 95% CI=1.81‚Äì15.30). Conclusions: Binge drinking may be an early indicator of vulnerability to alcohol use disorder and should be carefully assessed as part of a thorough clinical evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Discussions about the replicability of psychological studies have primarily focused on improving research methods and practices, with less attention paid to the role of well-specified theories in facilitating the production of reliable empirical results. The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology?what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.",

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE National epidemiologic information from recently collected data on the new DSM-5 classification of alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a reliable, valid, and uniform data source is needed. OBJECTIVE To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, associated disability, and treatment of DSM-5 AUD diagnoses overall and according to severity level (mild, moderate, or severe). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted face-to-face interviews with a representative US noninstitutionalized civilian adult (‚â•18 years) sample (N = 36 309) as the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III). Data were collected from April 2012 through June 2013 and analyzed in October 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD. RESULTS Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD were 13.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Prevalence was generally highest for men (17.6% and 36.0%, respectively), white (14.0% and 32.6%, respectively) and Native American (19.2% and 43.4%, respectively), respondents, and younger (26.7% and 37.0%, respectively) and previously married (11.4% and 27.1%, respectively) or never married (25.0% and 35.5%, respectively) adults. Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime severe AUD was greatest among respondents with the lowest income level (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively). Significant disability was associated with 12-month and lifetime AUD and increased with the severity of AUD. Only 19.8% of respondents with lifetime AUD were ever treated. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime AUD and other substance use disorders, major depressive and bipolar I disorders, and antisocial and borderline personality disorders across all levels of AUD severity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08-1.36) to 6.4 (95% CI, 5.76-7.22). Associations between AUD and panic disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were modest (odds ratios ranged from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.01-1.43) to 1.4 (95% CI, 1.13-1.67) across most levels of AUD severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alcohol use disorder defined by DSM-5 criteria is a highly prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling disorder that often goes untreated in the United States. The NESARC-III data indicate an urgent need to educate the public and policy makers about AUD and its treatment alternatives, to destigmatize the disorder, and to encourage those who cannot reduce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite substantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.",

            "abstract": "There is now a growing movement that views a number of behaviours as potentially addictive including many that do not involve the ingestion of a drug (such as gambling, sex, exercise, videogame playing and Internet use). This paper argues that all addictions consist of a number of distinct common components (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict and relapse). The paper argues that addictions are a part of a biopsychosocial process and evidence is growing that excessive behaviours of all types do seem to have many commonalities. It is argued that an eclectic approach to the studying of addictive behaviour appears to be the most pragmatic way forward in the field. Such commonalities may have implications not only for treatment of such behaviours but also for how the general public perceive such behaviours.",

            "abstract": "Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined‚Äîwhat we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.",

            "abstract": "Event-related potential studies of emotional processing have focused on the late positive potential (LPP), a sustained positive deflection in the ERP that is increased for emotionally arousing stimuli. A prominent theory suggests that modulation of the LPP is a response to stimulus significance, defined in terms of the activation of appetitive and aversive motivational systems. The current review incorporates experimental studies showing that manipulations that alter the significance of stimuli alter LPP amplitude. Complementing these within-person studies, also included is individual differences research on depression wherein the LPP has been used to study reduced neural sensitivity to emotional stimuli. Finally, the current review builds an existing framework that the LPP observed in studies in emotional processing and the P300 observed in classic oddball studies may reflect a common response to stimulus significance. This integrative account has implications for the functional interpretation of these ERPs, their neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical applications.",

            "abstract": "Human brains share a broadly similar functional organization with consequential individual variation. This duality in brain function has primarily been observed when using techniques that consider the spatial organization of the brain, such as MRI. Here, we ask whether these common and unique signals of cognition are also present in temporally sensitive but spatially insensitive neural signals. To address this question, we compiled electroencephalogram (EEG) data from individuals of both sexes while they performed multiple working memory tasks at two different data-collection sites (n = 171 and 165). Results revealed that trial-averaged EEG activity exhibited inter-electrode correlations that were stable within individuals and unique across individuals. Furthermore, models based on these inter-electrode correlations generalized across datasets to predict participants‚Äô working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence. Thus, inter-electrode correlation patterns measured with EEG provide a signature of working memory and fluid intelligence in humans and a new framework for characterizing individual differences in cognitive abilities.",

            "abstract": "Learning difficulties have been found to dilute the possibilities that young adults have in their educational careers. However, during the last few decades, education has become increasingly important for employment and overall life satisfaction. In the present study, we were interested in the effects of mathematical and reading difficulties and socioemotional and behavioural problems (measured at age 16) on three educational situations at age 21: delayed graduation from upper secondary education, short educational trajectory and not being engaged in education, employment or training (NEET). The participants (N = 597; 304 females, 293 males) were one age cohort of ninth graders in general education classes, who were followed for five years after completion of compulsory education. This time frame included two different transition phases: first, from comprehensive education to upper secondary education, and second, from upper secondary education to further studies or to working life. Structural equation modelling was used as analysis method. The findings show that mathematical and reading difficulties as well as socioemotional and behavioural problems had significant long-term effects on the participants‚Äôeducational careers. New in part was that these learning difficulties seemed to have somewhat divergent emphases on the three investigated life situations: (1) mathematical difficulties, more strongly than reading difficulties, caused the students to attain lower levels of education, (2) mathematical difficulties and socioemotional problems predicted a student ending up in the NEET group and (3) reading difficulties and behavioural problems predicted delayed graduation from upper secondary education.",

            "abstract": "Since 1997 the US National Institute on Drug Abuse has advocated a brain disease model of addiction (BDMA). We assess the strength of evidence for the BDMA in animals, neuroimaging studies of people with addiction, and current research on the role of genetics in addiction. We critically assess claims about the medical and social benefits of use of the BDMA because the social implications are often implied as a reason to accept this model. Furthermore, we argue that the BDMA is not supported by animal and neuroimaging evidence to the extent its advocates suggest; it has not helped to deliver more effective treatments for addiction; and its effect on public policies toward drugs and people with addiction has been modest. The focus of the BDMA is on disordered neurobiology in a minority of severely addicted individuals, which undermines the implementation of effective and cost-effective policies at the population level to discourage people from smoking tobacco and drinking heavily. The pursuit of high technology direct brain interventions to cure addiction when most individuals with addiction do not have access to effective psychosocial and drug treatments is questionable.",

            "abstract": "Idiographic modeling is rapidly gaining popularity, promising to tap into the within-person dynamics underlying psychological phenomena. To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.",

            "abstract": "Anhedonia is a condition in which the capacity of experiencing pleasure is totally or partially lost, and it refers to both a state symptom in various psychiatric disorders and a personality trait. It has a putative neural substrate, originating in the dopaminergic mesolimbic and mesocortical reward circuit. Anhedonia frequently occurs in mood disorders, as a negative symptom in schizophrenia, and in substance use disorders. In particular, we focus our attention on the relationships occurring between anhedonia and substance use disorders, as highlighted by many studies. Several authors suggested that anhedonia is an important factor involved in relapse as well as in the transition from recreational use to excessive drug intake. In particular, anhedonia has been found to be a frequent feature in alcoholics and addicted patients during acute and chronic withdrawal as well as in cocaine, stimulant, and cannabis abusers. Furthermore, in subjects with a substance dependence disorder, there is a significant correlation between anhedonia, craving, intensity of withdrawal symptoms, and psychosocial and personality characteristics. Therefore treating anhedonia in detoxified alcohol-dependent subjects could be critical in terms of relapse prevention strategies, given its strong relationship with craving.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the effects of violations of the sphericity assumption on Type I error rates for different methodical approaches of repeated measures analysis using a simulation approach. In contrast to previous simulation studies on this topic, up to nine measurement occasions were considered. Effects of the level of inter-correlations between measurement occasions on Type I error rates were considered for the first time. Two populations with non-violation of the sphericity assumption, one with uncorrelated measurement occasions and one with moderately correlated measurement occasions, were generated. One population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines uncorrelated with highly correlated measurement occasions. A second population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines moderately correlated and highly correlated measurement occasions. From these four populations without any between-group effect or within-subject effect 5,000 random samples were drawn. Finally, the mean Type I error rates for Multilevel linear models (MLM) with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN), MLM with compound-symmetry (MLM-CS) and for repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) models (without correction, with Greenhouse-Geisser-correction, and Huynh-Feldt-correction) were computed. To examine the effect of both the sample size and the number of measurement occasions, sample sizes of n = 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were considered as well as measurement occasions of m = 3, 6, and 9. With respect to rANOVA, the results plead for a use of rANOVA with Huynh-Feldt-correction, especially when the sphericity assumption is violated, the sample size is rather small and the number of measurement occasions is large. For MLM-UN, the results illustrate a massive progressive bias for small sample sizes (n = 20) and m = 6 or more measurement occasions. This effect could not be found in previous simulation studies with a smaller number of measurement occasions. The proportionality of bias and number of measurement occasions should be considered when MLM-UN is used. The good news is that this proportionality can be compensated by means of large sample sizes. Accordingly, MLM-UN can be recommended even for small sample sizes for about three measurement occasions and for large sample sizes for about nine measurement occasions.",

            "abstract": "People often ‚Äúmind wander‚Äù during everyday tasks, temporarily losing track of time, place, or current task goals. In laboratory-based tasks, mind wandering is often associated with performance decrements in behavioral variables and changes in neural recordings. Such empirical associations provide descriptive accounts of mind wandering ‚Äì how it affects ongoing task performance ‚Äì but fail to provide true explanatory accounts ‚Äì why it affects task performance. In this perspectives paper, we consider mind wandering as a neural state or process that affects the parameters of quantitative cognitive process models, which in turn affect observed behavioral performance. Our approach thus uses cognitive process models to bridge the explanatory divide between neural and behavioral data. We provide an overview of two general frameworks for developing a model-based cognitive neuroscience of mind wandering. The first approach uses neural data to segment observed performance into a discrete mixture of latent task-related and task-unrelated states, and the second regresses single-trial measures of neural activity onto structured trial-by-trial variation in the parameters of cognitive process models. We discuss the relative merits of the two approaches, and the research questions they can answer, and highlight that both approaches allow neural data to provide additional constraint on the parameters of cognitive models, which will lead to a more precise account of the effect of mind wandering on brain and behavior. We conclude by summarizing prospects for mind wandering as conceived within a model-based cognitive neuroscience framework, highlighting the opportunities for its continued study and the benefits that arise from using well-developed quantitative techniques to study abstract theoretical constructs.",

            "abstract": "Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established ‚Äì and thus those tasks become popular ‚Äì when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects ‚Äì low between-participant variability ‚Äì makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.",

            "abstract": "Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10-30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.",

Ziel der Arbeit (Fragestellung) Er√∂rterung der Vor- und Nachteile der neu verfassten Diagnosekriterien. Material und Methoden Diskussion unter Ber√ºcksichtigung neurobiologischer, sozialer und klinischer Forschungsergebnisse. Ergebnisse Im ICD-11 werden wie bisher Abh√§ngigkeitserkrankungen und sch√§dlicher Gebrauch unterschieden. Zur Diagnose der Abh√§ngigkeit werden die ehemals 6¬†Diagnosekriterien in 3 Paaren geb√ºndelt, von denen k√ºnftig 2 erf√ºllt sein m√ºssen. Innerhalb der Paare gen√ºgt ein erf√ºlltes Kriterium, damit das Paar als bejaht gilt. Unter Bezugnahme wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse im Suchtbereich zeigen sich Vor- und Nachteile. Hierbei k√∂nnte sich die Spezifit√§t der Diagnosestellung gegen√ºber dem ICD-10 verschlechtern, da pro Paar nur ein Kriterium erf√ºllt sein muss und somit die M√∂glichkeit besteht, dass nicht problematisches Konsumverhalten inkorrekt pathologisiert und falsch diagnostiziert wird. Das erscheint als problematisch, da die Definition des ICD-10 ‚ÄûAnhaltender Konsum trotz eindeutiger sch√§dlicher Folgen‚Äú, im ICD-11 weiter gefasst wird als ‚ÄûOft fortgef√ºhrter Konsum trotz Auftreten von Problemen‚Äú. Dies k√∂nnte dazu f√ºhren, dass das Kriterium einfach deshalb erf√ºllt wird, weil der Konsum einer Substanz in einem bestimmten Land illegal ist. In der bisher gr√∂√üten multinationalen Studie in 10¬†L√§ndern zur Konkordanz der Diagnosesysteme wurde unter Verwendung der ICD-11 die Alkoholabh√§ngigkeit ca. 10‚ÄÜ% h√§ufiger gestellt als mittels ICD-10. Schlussfolgerung In der ICD-11 werden die Diagnosen der Substanzabh√§ngig und des Missbrauchs als klinisch sinnvolle Syndrome aufrechterhalten. Ob die diagnostischen Neuerungen in der Praxis hilfreich sind oder beispielsweise negative soziale Auswirkungen f√ºr die Betroffenen im Sinne unangemessener Pathologisierung mit sich bringen, ist systematisch zu pr√ºfen. , Abstract Background In ICD(International Classification of Diseases)-11 the criteria for the diagnosis of substance dependence have been revised. Objective Discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the revised diagnostic criteria. Material and methods Discussion of criteria with respect to neurobiological, social and clinical research. Results In the new ICD-11, harmful drug use and substance dependence remain separate diagnostic categories. Regarding substance dependence, the former six diagnostic criteria are condensed into three pairs, two of which must be fulfilled to diagnose this disorder. Within the pairs, one affirmed symptom or aspect is sufficient for the new criterion to be fulfilled. With reference to scientific findings in the field of addiction, this appears to provide advantages as well as disadvantages. The specificity of the diagnosis of substance dependence might get worse compared to ICD-10, because only one symptom of the syndrome pairs has to be fulfilled in each newly constructed pair in order to fulfill the criterion. Therefore, the risk of false positive diagnosis of substance dependence could increase. This is a¬†potential reason for concern because the definition of ICD-10 ‚Äúpersisting substance use despite clear evidence of overtly harmful consequences‚Äù, is more broadly reworded in ICD-11 as ‚Äúsubstance use often continues despite the occurrence of problems‚Äù. This criterion may hence simply be fulfilled because a¬†substance is illegal in a¬†certain country. In the largest multinational study in 10¬†countries concerning concordance of diagnostic systems, alcohol dependence was diagnosed approximately 10% more often using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10. Conclusion In ICD-11 the well-established distinction between substance dependence and harmful drug use is preserved. Systematic studies are required to assess whether the new diagnostic criteria are clinically helpful or increase social problems by increasing false positive diagnoses of addiction.",

            "abstract": "Normative thinking about addiction has traditionally been divided between, on the one hand, a medical model which sees addiction as a disease characterized by compulsive and relapsing drug use over which the addict has little or no control and, on the other, a moral model which sees addiction as a choice characterized by voluntary behavior under the control of the addict. Proponents of the former appeal to evidence showing that regular consumption of drugs causes persistent changes in the brain structures and functions known to be involved in the motivation of behavior. On this evidence, it is often concluded that becoming addicted involves a transition from voluntary, chosen drug use to non-voluntary compulsive drug use. Against this view, proponents of the moral model provide ample evidence that addictive drug use involves voluntary chosen behavior. In this article we argue that although they are right about something, both views are mistaken. We present a third model that neither rules out the view of addictive drug use as compulsive, nor that it involves voluntary chosen behavior.",

            "abstract": "Many people fail to save what they need to for retirement (Munnell, Webb, and Golub-Sass 2009). Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by pre-committing to decisions, or elaborating the value of future rewards can both make decisions more future-oriented. In this article, we explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards, but with present and future selves. In line with thinkers who have suggested that people may fail, through a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves (; ), we propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources toward the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.",

            "abstract": "Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences. However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students‚Äîall in the field of psychology‚Äîwere asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers‚Äô performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding pvalues and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.",

            "abstract": "A brain‚Äìcomputer interface (BCI) is a communication system that translates brain-activity into commands for a computer or other devices. In other words, a BCI allows users to act on their environment by using only brain-activity, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. In this paper, we present a BCI that achieves high classification accuracy and high bitrates for both disabled and able-bodied subjects. The system is based on the P300 evoked potential and is tested with five severely disabled and four able-bodied subjects. For four of the disabled subjects classification accuracies of 100% are obtained. The bitrates obtained for the disabled subjects range between 10 and 25bits/min. The effect of different electrode configurations and machine learning algorithms on classification accuracy is tested. Further factors that are possibly important for obtaining good classification accuracy in P300-based BCI systems for disabled subjects are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Advances in methods for longitudinal data collection and analysis have prompted a surge of research on psychological processes. However, decisions about how to time assessments are often not explicitly tethered to theories about psychological processes but are instead justified on methodological (e.g., power) or practical (e.g., feasibility) grounds. In many cases, methodological decisions are not explicitly justified at all. The disconnect between theories about processes and the timing of assessments in longitudinal research has contributed to misspecified models, interpretive errors, mixed findings, and nonspecific conclusions. In this article, we argue that higher demands should be placed on researchers to connect theories to methods in longitudinal research. We review instances of this disconnect and offer potential solutions as they pertain to four general questions for longitudinal researchers: how time should be scaled, how many assessments are needed, how frequently assessments should occur, and when assessments should happen.",

            "abstract": "Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in psychology‚Äôs empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an ‚Äúobjective‚Äù measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.",

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a simple, non-invasive method of studying neurophysiology. ERPs reflect complex activity of neural networks to blame for discriminative behavior of people and recognition of novel stimuli. They are defined as brain voltage fluctuations linked in time with some physical or mental event. EEG is used to assess ERPs, and its use has grown in popularity since the 1960s. This article provides an overview of the ERP methods as well as the properties of the various ERP components (contingent negative variation, namely wave P300, Bereitschafts potential, and mismatch negativity). It also describes ERP alterations linked with neurologic and psychiatric disorders and discusses the possibility of using this technique in experimental psychology. ERPs may reveal psychophysiological characteristics in obsessive compulsive disorder patients, which may have therapeutic and pharmacological consequences. The P3 wave is the most significant and researched component of the ERP record. It is divided into two parts: P3a and P3b. The P3 wave has therapeutic significance, in addition to its application in neurophysiological and psychophysiological research. One neurophysiology indicator of cognitive impairment in depression is the P300 component of the ERPs. The severity of the illness as well as sociodemographic disparities is likely to influence individuals with neurotic disorders‚Äô access to psychiatric care in the general community.",

ERP studies exploring various aspects of brain functioning in children and adolescents with AD/HD are reviewed, with a focus on group effects and interpretations in the domains of attention, inhibitory control, performance monitoring, non-pharmacological treatments, and ERP/energetics interactions. There has been a distinct shift in research intensity over the past 10years, with a large increase in ERP studies conducted in the areas of inhibitory control and performance monitoring. Overall, the research has identified a substantial number of ERP correlates of AD/HD. Robust differences from healthy controls have been reported in early orienting, inhibitory control, and error-processing components. These data offer potential to improve our understanding of the specific brain dysfunction(s) which contribute to the disorder. The literature would benefit from a more rigorous approach to clinical group composition and consideration of age effects, as well as increased emphasis on replication and extension studies using exacting participant, task, and analysis parameters.",

            "abstract": "There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.",

            "abstract": "Throughout social and cognitive psychology, participants are routinely asked to respond in some way to experimental stimuli that are thought to represent categories of theoretical interest. For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells & Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, & Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002).",

Furthermore, the heterogeneity in previous research is addressed by analyzing potentially relevant demographic and methodological moderators (age group, IQ, medication, comorbidity, task, cognitive function, modality, inter-stimulusinterval, number of electrodes). Via database search 52 relevant articles were identified including n = 1576 ADHD and n = 1794 non-ADHD. Using multilevel-models, pooled effect sizes were calculated. For earlier components, individuals with ADHD showed shorter Go-P100-latencies than non-ADHD. For later ERPs, individuals with ADHD showed smaller Cue-P300-amplitudes, longer Go-P300-latencies, smaller NoGo-P300amplitudes, longer NoGo-P300-latencies, smaller CNV-amplitudes, and smaller Pe-amplitudes. The substantial heterogeneity identified for most of the ERP components could be explained by the demographic and methodological moderators of interest. This meta-analysis identified relevant moderate group differences (‚àí0.32 < d < ‚àí0.57), mainly regarding later cognitive ERPs. Nevertheless, results are characterized by substantial heterogeneity and the moderate effect sizes (d < 0.6) limit the use for clinical application.",

This information may be of limited help in the development of potential auxiliary agents for treatment of addiction. However, a reductionist approach which attempts to analyse addiction at ever finer levels of structure and function, is inherently incapable of explaining what causes these mechanisms to be brought into play in some cases and not in others, or by self-administration of a drug but not by passive exposure. There is abundant evidence that psychological, social, economic and specific situational factors play important roles in initiating addiction, in addition to genetic and other biological factors. Therefore, if we hope to be able to make predictions at any but a statistical level, or to develop effective means of prevention, it is necessary to devise appropriate integrative approaches to the study of addiction, rather than pursue an ever-finer reductive approach which leads steadily farther away from the complex interaction of drug, user, environment and specific situations that characterizes the problem in humans.",

However, a reductionist approach which attempts to analyse addiction at ever finer levels of structure and function, is inherently incapable of explaining what causes these mechanisms to be brought into play in some cases and not in others, or by self-administration of a drug but not by passive exposure. There is abundant evidence that psychological, social, economic and specific situational factors play important roles in initiating addiction, in addition to genetic and other biological factors. Therefore, if we hope to be able to make predictions at any but a statistical level, or to develop effective means of prevention, it is necessary to devise appropriate integrative approaches to the study of addiction, rather than pursue an ever-finer reductive approach which leads steadily farther away from the complex interaction of drug, user, environment and specific situations that characterizes the problem in humans.",

            "abstract": "The present study examined the mechanisms underlying stimulus sequence effects on the parietal P300 and frontal P3a elicited by infrequent targets in an oddball paradigm and compared these effects between young and older adults. Fifty young and 50 healthy older adults completed a simple visual oddball task including an infrequent (20%) target stimulus. A temporo-spatial principal component (PCA) analysis was used to disentangle the parietal P300 and frontal P3a from overlapping ERP components. The typical age-related anterior-shift of the P300 was, according to the PCA, due to a disproportionately large contribution of a frontal P3a in older adults. Up to about five successive standards preceding a target, the results replicated the typical increase in parietal P300 amplitude to targets with increases in preceding standards. A novel finding was that with further increases in preceding standards, P300 amplitude to targets gradually decreased. This pattern is consistent with a combination of relatively automatic, temporary expectations and higher level, conscious expectations driving P300 sequential effects, with different dynamics over the course of successively presented standards. However, an expectancy-based account of these sequential effects was challenged by an analogous analysis of RTs. Sequential effects on the frontal P3a differed from the parietal P300: The P3a was largest when a target followed another target and continually decreased with the number of intervening standards. Notably, sequential effects were strikingly similar for young and older adults, and implications for the functional significance of morphological changes in P300 due to aging are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Computational models have been used to analyze the data from behavioral experiments. One objective of the use of computational models is to estimate model parameters or internal variables for individual subjects from behavioral data. The estimates are often correlated with other variables that characterize subjects in order to investigate which computational processes are associated with specific personal or physiological traits. Although the accuracy of the estimates is important for these purposes, the parameter estimates obtained from individual subject data are often unreliable. To solve this problem, researchers have begun to use hierarchical modeling approaches to estimate parameters of computational models from multiple-subject data. It is widely accepted that the hierarchical model provides reliable estimates compared to other non-hierarchical approaches. However, how and under what conditions the hierarchical models provide better estimates than other approaches has yet to be systematically investigated. This study attempts to investigate these issues, focusing on two measures of estimation accuracy: the correlation between estimates of individual parameters and subject trait variables and the absolute measures of error (root mean squared error, RMSE) of the estimates. An analytical calculation based on a simple Gaussian model clarifies how the hierarchical model improves the point estimates of these two measures. We also performed simulation studies employing several realistic computational models based on the synthesized data to confirm that the theoretical properties hold in realistic situations.",

These procedures included several techniques to determine onset latencies combined with approaches using both single-participant average waveforms and jackknife-subsample average waveforms. In general, the jackknife-based approach combined with the relative criterion technique or combined with the fractional area technique (J.C. Hansen & S.A. Hillyard, 1980; S.J.

            "abstract": "Variation of the P300 component was studied in normal children and adults during an auditory oddball paradigm. In children, the target stimuli that were preceded by a large number of standard stimuli elicited about twice as large P300 with a significantly shorter latency, a more widespread distribution, and an earlier positivity in the frontal area than those that were preceded by a small number of standard stimuli. The P300 variation was not as marked in adults as in children. Based on the context updating theory of the P300, the finding suggests that a long intertarget interval (ITI) results in a profound decay of the neural representation of the target stimulus in children; consequently, more resources are needed to update the neural representation, and the target may even be processed as a novel input. The P300 variation may provide information about the brain functions related to memory, attention, and orienting in children. This variation should be considered when assessing cognitive brain functions with event-related potentials in children.",

            "abstract": "To examine whether learning difficulties play a role in depressive symptoms, 658 Finnish adolescents were asked to complete scales for depression three times during the transition to post-comprehensive education. They also reported on their learning difficulties and feelings of inadequacy as a student. The results showed that learning difficulties prospectively predicted depressive symptoms. Moreover, the impact of learning difficulties was mediated via inadequacy as a student: learning difficulties predicted feelings of inadequacy as a student which, in turn, contributed to greater increases in depressive symptoms. Finally, gender moderated the association between learning difficulties and depressive symptoms: both being a girl and having a high level of learning difficulties predicted a higher initial level of depressive symptoms.",

In this review, we discuss the opportunities that these efforts offer for the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. We focus on issues broadly related to statistical power and to flexibility and transparency in data analyses. Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies also involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, modelling across the lifespan, the analyses of longitudinal changes, and neuroimaging data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental cognitive neuroscience, and how preregistration of studies can improve methodological rigor in the field. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is ever-growing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.",

            "abstract": "Researchers in clinical psychophysiology make several methodological decisions during the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). In the current study, we review these choices from the perspective of individual differences. We focus on baseline period and reference scheme (i.e., average, mastoid, current source density)‚àí as well as choices regarding where (i.e., single electrode site vs. pooling of sites), when (i.e., area, area around peak) and how (i.e., subtraction- or regression-based difference scores) to quantify ERPs. To illustrate the impact of these analytic pathways on internal consistency reliability and individual differences, we focus on the error-related negativity (ERN) and anxiety‚Äîand present data from two samples: first, in adults with diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); second, in relation to continuous self-reported symptoms of GAD in a large community sample of adolescent females. Results generally indicated similar internal consistency and between-subject effect sizes across all evaluated methods. Nonetheless, some patterns of variation emerged, such as that across both datasets difference-based ERN measures, especially with mastoid reference, yielded more robust associations with GAD diagnosis and symptoms, despite somewhat lower internal consistency. The current analyses suggest that the association between ERN and anxiety is robust across a range of commonly used methodological choices. The present study is an example of how systematic analyses of analytic strategies on measures of internal consistency and between-subject variability could help inform individual differences ERP research., This study systematically explores the effects of different EEG analytic choices on the internal consistency of a neural measure and its relation to symptoms of anxiety in two independent data sets. Results indicate psychometric properties of the error-related negativity (ERN) are robust across a range of commonly used methodological choices.",

            "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Persistent medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are a major burden for health care. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious for patients with MUS, with small to medium effects. The current study investigates whether therapy outcomes of a CBT for MUS patients can be improved by complementing it with emotion regulation training. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In a multicentre trial 255 patients with at least three persisting MUS were randomised to 20 sessions of either conventional CBT (<i>n</i> = 128) or CBT complemented with emotion regulation training (ENCERT; <i>n</i> = 127). Somatic symptom severity and secondary outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, therapy session 8, end of therapy, and 6-month follow-up. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Linear mixed-effect models revealed medium to large effects in both study arms for almost all outcomes at the end of therapy and 6-month follow-up. ENCERT and CBT did not differ in their effect on the primary outcome (<i>d</i> = 0.20, 95% CI: ‚Äì0.04 to 0.44). Significant time √ó group cross-level interactions suggested ENCERT to be of more benefit than conventional CBT for a few secondary outcomes. Moderator analyses revealed higher effects of ENCERT in patients with co-morbid mental disorders. <b><i>Discussion/Conclusions:</i></b> Current findings are based on a representative sample. Results demonstrate that both CBT and ENCERT can achieve strong effects on primary and secondary outcomes in MUS patients. Our results do not indicate that adding a training in emotion regulation skills generally improves the effect of CBT across all patients with MUS. Large effect sizes of both treatments and potential specific benefits of ENCERT for patients with co-morbid mental disorders are discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that the amplitude of the P300 component of event-related brain potentials is sensitive to the degree to which eliciting stimuli are surprising to the observers (Donchin, 1981). While Squires et al. (1976) showed and modeled dependencies of P300 amplitudes from observed stimuli on various time scales, Mars et al. (2008) proposed a computational model keeping track of stimulus probabilities on a long-term time scale. We suggest here a computational model which integrates prior information with short-term, long-term, and alternation-based experiential influences on P300 amplitude fluctuations. To evaluate the new model, we measured trial-by-trial P300 amplitude fluctuations in a simple two-choice response time task, and tested the computational models of trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes using Bayesian model evaluation. The results reveal that the new digital filtering (DIF) model provides a superior account of the trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes when compared to both Squires et al.‚Äôs (1976) model, and Mars et al.‚Äôs (2008) model. We show that the P300-generating system can be described as two parallel first-order infinite impulse response (IIR) low-pass filters and an additional fourth-order finite impulse response (FIR) high-pass filter. Implications of the acquired data are discussed with regard to the neurobiological distinction between short-term, long-term, and working memory as well as from the point of view of predictive coding models and Bayesian learning theories of cortical function.",

            "abstract": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been widely used to investigate brain functioning in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in both research and diagnostic settings. To ensure the efficiency of ERP techniques in ADHD diagnosis and in longitudinal observational studies, the test-retest reliability of the affected population must be validated. Thus, the present article assesses the short-term test-retest reliability of certain early and late ERPs (i.e., P1, N1, N2, P2, P3), as well as independent components (ICs) decomposed from the above mentioned ERPs (IC P3 Go, IC P3 NoGo early, IC P3 NoGo late) relevant to ADHD, through the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). More specifically, we employ a cued visual Go/NoGo paradigm for recording ERPs from 22 children with ADHD (mean age 12.2), twice within 30min. Amplitudes and latencies are calculated by the ‚Äúpeak amplitude‚Äù method and by a variation of the fractional area. Results for amplitudes lie mostly within the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù range for both measurement methods, while ICC for latencies is more variable ranging from ‚Äúpoor‚Äù to ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù results. Crucially, the ICs, which are associated with distinct functionally independent processes of the executive attentional system have shown a comparable test-retest reliability with the raw ERPs. Our results are consistent with other reliability studies of neurotypical population in the literature, and as such, consist initial evidence that ERPs could be reliable neurophysiological markers for the ADHD population.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction requires an integration of basic neuroscience with social psychology, experimental psychology, and psychiatry. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in compulsive drug use and a loss of control over drug-taking. Sensitization and counteradaptation are hypothesized to contribute to this hedonic homeostatic dysregulation, and the neurobiological mechanisms involved, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system, opioid peptidergic systems, and brain and hormonal stress systems, are beginning to be characterized. This framework provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and to relapse in individuals with a history of addiction.",

            "abstract": "The capability of the human brain for Bayesian inference was assessed by manipulating probabilistic contingencies in an urn-ball task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to stimuli that differed in their relative frequency of occurrence (.18 to .82). A veraged ERPs with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (relative frequency of occurrence > .5) were used for further analysis. Research hypotheses about relationships between probabilistic contingencies and ERP amplitude variations were formalized as (in-)equality constrained hypotheses. Conducting Bayesian model comparisons, we found that manipulations of prior probabilities and likelihoods were associated with separately modifiable and distinct ERP responses. P3a amplitudes were sensitive to the degree of prior certainty such that higher prior probabilities were related to larger frontally distributed P3a waves. P3b amplitudes were sensitive to the degree of likelihood certainty such that lower likelihoods were associated with larger parietally distributed P3b waves. These ERP data suggest that these antecedents of Bayesian inference (prior probabilities and likelihoods) are coded by the human brain.",

We conducted five passive oddball experiments, in which the number of deviants (i.e., one or two), their alleged meaning, and their distinctiveness varied.ResultsMastoid- or common-referenced waveforms showed a fronto-central N3 in all experiments. The data were CSD (Current Source Density) transformed and underwent a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed N3 containing two subcomponents with very stable peak latencies of about 415 and 455 ms, respectively. Both topography of the subcomponents and their variation with experimental conditions were very similar, indicating a midfrontal sink and a posterior temporal source. An analysis of P3a and P3b components replicated previously known effects.ConclusionWe discuss the similarities and differences between the passive N3 and other components including the MMN, N1, late positive Slow Wave, and reorienting negativity. We also make general hypotheses about a possible functional meaning of N3; on this basis, specific hypotheses are formulated and further experiments are suggested to test these hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: The present study examines the relationships between processing speed (PS), mental health disorders, and learning disorders. Prior work has tended to explore relationships between PS deficits and specific diagnoses in isolation of one another. Here, we simultaneously investigated PS associations with five diagnoses (i.e., anxiety, autism, ADHD, depressive, specific learning) in a large-scale, transdiagnostic, community self-referred sample. Method. 843 children, ages 8‚Äì16 were included from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Biobank. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to create a composite measure of four PS tasks, referred to as PC1. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the four PS measures, as well as PC1, were calculated to assess reliability. Results. ICCs were moderate between WISC-V tasks (0.663), and relatively modest between NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison and other PS scales (0.14‚Äì0.27). Regression analyses revealed specific significant relationships between PS and reading and math disabilities, ADHD-inattentive presentation (ADHD-I), and ADHD-combined presentation (ADHD-C). After accounting for inattention, the present study did not find a significant relationship with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Discussion. Our examination of PS in a large, transdiagnostic sample suggested more specific associations with ADHD and learning disorders than the literature currently suggests. Implications for understanding how PS interacts with a highly heterogeneous childhood sample are discussed.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes a heuristic framework for the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment that incorporates key functional domains derived from the neurocircuitry of addiction. We review how addictive disorders (ADs) are presently diagnosed and the need for new neuroclinical measures to differentiate patients who meet clinical criteria for addiction to the same agent while differing in etiology, prognosis, and treatment response. The need for a better understanding of the mechanisms provoking and maintaining addiction, as evidenced by the limitations of current treatments and within-diagnosis clinical heterogeneity, is articulated. In addition, recent changes in the nosology of ADs, challenges to current classification systems, and prior attempts to subtype individuals with ADs are described. Complementary initiatives, including the Research Domain Criteria project, that have established frameworks for the neuroscience of psychiatric disorders are discussed. Three domains‚Äîexecutive function, incentive salience, and negative emotionality‚Äîtied to different phases in the cycle of addiction form the core functional elements of ADs. Measurement of these domains in epidemiologic, genetic, clinical, and treatment studies will provide the underpinnings for an understanding of cross-population and temporal variation in addictions, shared mechanisms in addictive disorders, impact of changing environmental influences, and gene identification. Finally, we show that it is practical to implement such a deep neuroclinical assessment using a combination of neuroimaging and performance measures. Neuroclinical assessment is key to reconceptualizing the nosology of ADs on the basis of process and etiology, an advance that can lead to improved prevention and treatment.",

            "abstract": "Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.",

            "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are among the most common and debilitating illnesses across the lifespan and begin usually during childhood and adolescence, which emphasizes the importance of studying the developing brain. Most of the previous pediatric neuroimaging studies employed traditional univariate statistics on relatively small samples. Multivariate machine learning approaches have a great potential to overcome the limitations of these approaches. On the other hand, the vast majority of existing multivariate machine learning studies have focused on differentiating between children with an isolated psychiatric disorder and typically developing children. However, this line of research does not reflect the real-life situation as the majority of children with a clinical diagnosis have multiple psychiatric disorders (multimorbidity), and consequently, a clinician has the task to choose between different diagnoses and/or the combination of multiple diagnoses. Thus, the goal of the present benchmark is to predict psychiatric multimorbidity in children and adolescents. For this purpose, we implemented two kinds of machine learning benchmark challenges: The first challenge targets the prediction of the seven most prevalent DSM-V psychiatric diagnoses for the available data set, of which each individual can exhibit multiple ones concurrently (i.e. multi-task multi-label classification). Based on behavioral and cognitive measures, a second challenge focuses on predicting psychiatric symptom severity on a dimensional level (i.e. multiple regression task). For the present benchmark challenges, we will leverage existing and future data from the biobank of the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) initiative, which offers a unique large-sample dataset (N¬†=¬†2042) that provides a wide array of different psychiatric developmental disorders and true hidden data sets. Due to limited real-world practicability and economic viability of MRI measurements, the present challenge will permit only resting state EEG data and demographic information to derive predictive models. We believe that a community driven effort to derive predictive markers from these data using advanced machine learning algorithms can help to improve the diagnosis of psychiatric developmental disorders.",

            "abstract": "Objective: To review deficits in emotional processing and social cognition potentially contributing to the dysfunctional emotion regulation and difficulties with interpersonal relationships observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to provide directions for future research. Method: First is presented a review of emotional and social cognitive impairments in recently detoxified AUD individuals that include alexithymia, difficulties in decoding others‚Äô emotions, and reduced theory of mind and empathy skills. Social cognition disorders in AUD pose different issues discussed, such as whether (1) these deficits are consequences of excessive alcohol consumption or premorbid risk factors for addiction, (2) emotional and social impairments impede positive treatment outcome, (3) recovery of social abilities is possible with sustained abstinence, and (4) AUD patients are unaware of their emotional and social dysfunctions. Finally, current knowledge on structural and functional brain correlates of these deficits in AUD are reviewed. Results: Emotional and social cognitive functions affected in AUD can potentially compromise efforts to initiate and maintain abstinence by hampering efficacy of clinical treatment. Such dysfunction can obstruct efforts to enable or re-instate higher-order abilities such as emotional self-regulation, motivation to change, success in interpersonal/social interactions, and emotional insight and awareness of social dysfunctions (i.e., accurate metacognition). Conclusions: The present review highlights the need to account for emotional processing and social cognition in the evaluation and rehabilitation of alcohol-related neurocognitive disorders and to consider psychotherapeutic treatment involving remediation of emotional and social skills as implemented in psychiatric and neurological disorders.",

            "abstract": "We develop and evaluate a model of behavior on the Give-N task, a commonly used measure of young children‚Äôs number knowledge. Our model uses the knower-level theory of how children represent numbers. To produce behavior on the Give-N task, the model assumes that children start out with a base rate that makes some answers more likely a priori than others but is updated on each experimental trial in a way that depends on the interaction between the experimenter‚Äôs request and the child‚Äôs knower level. We formalize this process as a generative graphical model, so that the parameters‚Äîincluding the base rate distribution and each child‚Äôs knower level‚Äîcan be inferred from data using Bayesian methods. Using this approach, we evaluate the model on previously published data from 82 children spanning the whole developmental range. The model provides an excellent fit to these data, and the inferences about the base rate and knower levels are interpretable and insightful. We discuss how our modeling approach can be extended to other developmental tasks and can be used to help evaluate alternative theories of number representation against the knower-level theory.",

            "abstract": "The goal of typology research is to identify subtypes of alcohol dependent (AD) patients sharing fundamental characteristics and try to match each subtype, with the most precise treatment strategy. This review provides a comprehensive history of the literature on alcohol dependent subtypes starting from the earliest attempt made by Jellinek. The binary models identified most closely with Cloninger and Babor as well as the successively more complex classifications are discussed. Typology classification potentially useful in guiding the treatment of AD patients, especially in the case of the serotonergic medications. Contrasting data suggests that other factors could influence the response to a medication and/or that more complex typologies should be identified. In summary, typology models may assist in the ascertainment criteria for clinical trials performed in behavioral and pharmacotherapeutic interventions. Greater emphasis, however, must be made to more clearly delineate this field of research, while moving toward more standardized typologies.",

            "abstract": "The limited capacity of recent memory inevitably leads to partial memory of past stimuli. There is also evidence that behavioral and neural responses to novel or rare stimuli are dependent on one‚Äôs memory of past stimuli. Thus, these responses may serve as a probe of different individuals‚Äô remembering and forgetting characteristics. Here, we utilize two lossy compression models of stimulus sequences that inherently involve forgetting, which in addition to being a necessity under many conditions, also has theoretical and behavioral advantages. One model is based on a simple stimulus counter and the other on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework which suggests a more general, theoretically justifiable principle for biological and cognitive phenomena. These models are applied to analyze a novelty-detection event-related potential commonly known as the P300. The trial-by-trial variations of the P300 response, recorded in an auditory oddball paradigm, were subjected to each model to extract two stimulus-compression parameters for each subject: memory length and representation accuracy. These parameters were then utilized to estimate the subjects‚Äô recent memory capacity limit under the task conditions. The results, along with recently published findings on single neurons and the IB model, underscore how a lossy compression framework can be utilized to account for trial-by-trial variability of neural responses at different spatial scales and in different individuals, while at the same time providing estimates of individual memory characteristics at different levels of representation using a theoretically-based parsimonious model.",

            "abstract": "The claim that addiction is a brain disease is almost universally accepted among scientists who work on addiction. The claim‚Äôs attraction rests on two grounds: the fact that addiction seems to be characterized by dysfunction in specific neural pathways and the fact that the claim seems to the compassionate response to people who are suffering. I argue that neural dysfunction is not sufficient for disease: something is a brain disease only when neural dysfunction is sufficient for impairment. I claim that the neural dysfunction that is characteristic of addiction is not sufficient for impairment, because people who suffer from that dysfunction are impaired, sufficiently to count as diseased, only given certain features of their context. Hence addiction is not a brain disease (though it is often a disease, and it may always involve brain dysfunction). I argue that accepting that addiction is not a brain disease does not entail a moralizing attitude toward people who suffer as a result of addiction; if anything, it allows for a more compassionate, and more effective, response to addiction.",

            "abstract": "There is a broad agreement that psychology is facing a replication crisis. Even some seemingly well-established findings have failed to replicate. Numerous causes of the crisis have been identified, such as underpowered studies, publication bias, imprecise theories, and inadequate statistical procedures. The replication crisis is real, but it is less clear how it should be resolved. Here we examine potential solutions by modeling a scientific community under various different replication regimes. In one regime, all findings are replicated before publication to guard against subsequent replication failures. In an alternative regime, individual studies are published and are replicated after publication, but only if they attract the community‚Äôs interest. We find that the publication of potentially non-replicable studies minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency of knowledge gain for the scientific community under a variety of assumptions. Provided it is properly managed, our findings suggest that low replicability can support robust and efficient science.",

            "abstract": "The major advantage of MEG/EEG over other neuroimaging methods is its high temporal resolution. Examining the latency of well-studied components can provide a window into the dynamics of cognitive operations beyond traditional response-time (RT) measurements. While RTs reflect the cumulative duration of all time-consuming cognitive operations involved in a task, component latencies can partition this time into cognitively meaningful sub-steps. Surprisingly, most MEG/EEG studies neglect this advantage and restrict analyses to component amplitudes without considering latencies. The major reasons for this neglect might be that, first, the most easily accessible latency measure (peak latency) is often unreliable and that, second, more complex measures are difficult to conceive, implement, and parametrize. The present article illustrates the key advantages and disadvantages of the three main types of latency-measures (peak latency, onset latency, and percent-area latency), introduces a MATLAB function that extracts all these measures and is compatible with common analysis tools, discusses the most important parameter choices for different research questions and components of interest, and demonstrates its use by various group analyses on one planar gradiometer pair of the publicly available Wakeman and Henson (2015) data. The introduced function can extract from group data not only single-subject latencies, but also grand-average and jackknife latencies. Furthermore, it gives the choice between different approaches to automatically set baselines and anchor points for latency estimation, approaches that were partly developed by me and that capitalize on the informational richness of MEG/EEG data. Although the function comes with a wide range of customization parameters, the default parameters are set so that even beginners get reasonable results. Graphical depictions of latency estimates, baselines, and anchor points overlaid on individual averages further support learning, understanding and trouble-shooting. Once extracted, latency estimates can be submitted to any analysis also available for (averaged) RTs, including tests for mean differences, correlational approaches and cognitive modeling.",

            "abstract": "Since at least the middle of the past century, one overarching model of psychiatric classification, namely, that of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases (DSM-ICD), has reigned supreme. This DSM-ICD approach embraces an Aristotelian view of mental disorders as largely discrete entities that are characterized by distinctive signs, symptoms, and natural histories. Over the past several years, however, a competing vision, namely, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative launched by the National Institute of Mental Health, has emerged in response to accumulating anomalies within the DSM-ICD system. In contrast to DSM-ICD, RDoC embraces a Galilean view of psychopathology as the product of dysfunctions in neural circuitry. RDoC appears to be a valuable endeavor that holds out the long-term promise of an alternative system of mental illness classification. We delineate three sets of pressing challenges ‚Äì conceptual, methodological, and logistical/pragmatic ‚Äì that must be addressed for RDoC to realize its scientific potential, and conclude with a call for further research, including investigation of a rapprochement between Aristotelian and Galilean approaches to psychiatric classification.",

            "abstract": "The Internet has provided IS researchers with the opportunity to conduct studies with extremely large samples, frequently well over 10,000 observations. There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.",

            "abstract": "Based on an interactive road-crossing task, this study examined age-related effects on crossing decisions and whether or not age affects behavioral adjustments to the time gap. It also compared crossing-task decisions to previously observed estimation-task decisions [Lobjois, R., Cavallo, V., 2007. Age-related differences in street-crossing decisions: the effects of vehicle speed and time constraints on gap selection in an estimation task. Accident Analysis and Prevention 39 (5), 934‚Äì943]. The results showed that older adults selected a greater mean time gap and initiated their crossing sooner than the younger ones, indicating an attempt to compensate for their increased crossing time. However, older adults accepted shorter and shorter time gaps as speed increased, putting them at a higher risk at high speeds. Regarding adaptive behavior, the analyses showed that all groups adjusted their crossing time to the available time. Comparison of crossing decisions and estimations revealed that the young group had a greater number of tight fits and missed fewer opportunities on the crossing task, whereas these differences did not appear in the elderly. This suggests that the crossing decisions of younger adults are much more finely tuned to time gaps in actual crossing tasks than in estimation tasks and that older adults have trouble calibrating perception and action and perceiving possibilities for action.",

            "abstract": "Life-span development is inherently linked to the perception of time and associated temporal construals. Such concepts are multi-faceted in nature and have important practical implications in areas such as time management, financial planning, or medical choices. A large body of research has documented age-related limitations in global time horizons, but age differences in other aspects of temporal construal are comparatively poorly understood. The present article draws attention to developmental trajectories of self-continuity, defined as perceived associations of one‚Äôs present self with past and future selves. After considering historical roots and contemporary views on self-continuity, we turn to the life-span developmental literature and review several convergent streams of research that provide indirect evidence for age-related increases in self-continuity. We then consider a small body of recent studies which have directly assessed age differences in self-continuity and summarize our current understanding of this phenomenon including associations between explicit and implicit measures, symmetry between past and future self-continuity, and differentiation from other aspects of time perception. We conclude by highlighting open theoretical questions and considering the practical implications of an increased sense of self-continuity with advancing age.",

            "abstract": "Age differences in decision-making are of theoretical interest and have important practical implications, but relevant lines of work are distributed across multiple disciplines and often lack integration. The present review proposes an overarching conceptual framework with the aim of connecting disjointed aspects of this field of research. The framework builds on process models of decision-making and specifies potential mechanisms behind age effects as well as relevant moderators including task characteristics and contextual factors. After summarizing the extant literature for each aspect of the framework, compensatory mechanisms and ecological fit between different components of the model are considered. Implications for real-life decision-making, remaining research gaps, and directions for future research are discussed.",

            "abstract": "ERP experiments generate massive datasets, often containing thousands of values for each participant, even after averaging. The richness of these datasets can be very useful in testing sophisticated hypotheses, but this richness also creates many opportunities to obtain effects that are statistically significant but do not reflect true differences among groups or conditions (bogus effects). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how common and seemingly innocuous methods for quantifying and analyzing ERP effects can lead to very high rates of significant but bogus effects, with the likelihood of obtaining at least one such bogus effect exceeding 50% in many experiments. We focus on two specific problems: using the grand-averaged data to select the time windows and electrode sites for quantifying component amplitudes and latencies, and using one or more multifactor statistical analyses. Reanalyses of prior data and simulations of typical experimental designs are used to show how these problems can greatly increase the likelihood of significant but bogus results. Several strategies are described for avoiding these problems and for increasing the likelihood that significant effects actually reflect true differences among groups or conditions.",

            "abstract": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) can be very noisy, and yet, there is no widely accepted metric of ERP data quality. Here, we propose a universal measure of data quality for ERP research‚Äîthe standardized measurement error (SME)‚Äîwhich is a special case of the standard error of measurement. Whereas some existing metrics provide a generic quantification of the noise level, the SME quantifies the data quality (precision) for the specific amplitude or latency value being measured in a given study (e.g., the peak latency of the P3 wave). It can be applied to virtually any value that is derived from averaged ERP waveforms, making it a universal measure of data quality. In addition, the SME quantifies the data quality for each individual participant, making it possible to identify participants with low-quality data and ‚Äúbad‚Äù channels. When appropriately aggregated across individuals, SME values can be used to quantify the combined impact of the single-trial EEG noise and the number of trials being averaged together on the effect size and statistical power in a given experiment. If SME values were regularly included in published articles, researchers could identify the recording and analysis procedures that produce the highest data quality, which could ultimately lead to increased effect sizes and greater replicability across the field.",

            "abstract": "Visual working memory capacity is of great interest because it is strongly correlated with overall cognitive ability, can be understood at the level of neural circuits, and is easily measured. Recent studies have shown that capacity influences tasks ranging from saccade targeting to analogical reasoning. A debate has arisen over whether capacity is constrained by a limited number of discrete representations or by an infinitely divisible resource, but the empirical evidence and neural network models currently favor a discrete item limit. Capacity differs markedly across individuals and groups, and recent research indicates that some of these differences reflect true differences in storage capacity whereas others reflect variations in the ability to use memory capacity efficiently.",

            "abstract": "Summary: Purpose: Psychological interventions in the treatment of epilepsy have been developed and evaluated for many years but the amount of research has hardly made an impact on how epilepsy is treated. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a psychological treatment program consisting of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) together with some behavioral seizure control technology shown to be successful in earlier research. Methods: The method consisted of a randomized controlled trial group design with repeated measures (n = 27). All participants had an EEG verified epilepsy diagnosis with drug refractory seizures. Participants were randomized into one of two conditions, ACT or supportive therapy (ST). Therapeutic effects were measured by examining changes in quality of life (SWLS and WHOQOL) and seizure index (frequency √ó duration). Both treatment conditions consisted of only nine hours of professional therapy distributed in two individual and two group sessions during a four-week period. Results: The results showed significant effects over all of the dependent variables for the ACT group as compared to the ST group at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that a short-term psychotherapy program combined with anticonvulsant drugs may help to prevent the long-term disability that occurs from drug refractory seizures.",

            "abstract": "Delay discounting (or temporal discounting) refers to the decrease of the subjective value of a reward as the time interval for receiving that reward increases. A recent meta-analysis showed that delay discounting appears to be similar across the lifespan as younger, middle-aged, and older adults prefer sooner rewards, despite smaller, over later rewards, even if larger. However further investigation is needed to understand the potential role of individual factors in delay discounting across the lifespan. The present study aimed to contribute to this debate, by investigating the influence of sociodemographic, neurocognitive, and psychological variables on delay discounting. For this purpose, 88 participants (30 younger, 30 middle-aged, and 28 older adults) aged between 19 and 73 years old completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ), a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests, and self-report measures of psychopathology. Results revealed no group differences in the rate of discounting. A well-established effect of the amount of the delayed reward was replicated, showing that medium rewards were less discounted than smaller rewards, and larger rewards had lower discounting rates than smaller and medium rewards‚Äîthe magnitude effect. Regarding the influence of neurocognitive and psychological factors on delay discounting, better working memory, as assessed by the Corsi block-tapping task, significantly predicted larger magnitude effects. The findings of the current work are consistent with the results of previous studies, suggesting that temporal discounting is a stable function across the adult life span.

            "abstract": "Objective.Students with severe learning disabilities often show signs of anxiety, depression, and problem behaviors such as inattention and conduct problems. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in school settings constitute a promising option to alleviate these co-occurring symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the impact of an MBI on symptoms and behaviors of elementary school students with severe learning disabilities.Method.A one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The sample comprised 14 students aged 9 to 12 years with special education needs. Both student-report and teacher-report of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition were used.Results.Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a significant impact of the MBI on symptoms and behaviors such as anxiety, depression, inattention, aggression, and conduct problems. Effect sizes for all variables were considered large (partial ?2 = .31-.61).Conclusion.These preliminary results indicate that MBIs can reduce the frequency of symptoms and problem behaviors often found in children with learning disabilities in elementary schools. Further multiple baseline experimental trials with a long-term follow-up are warranted to establish more robustly the effect of MBIs for children with learning disabilities.",

            "abstract": "Personality traits are stable predictors of many life outcomes that are associated with important decisions that involve tradeoffs over time. Therefore, a fundamental question is how tradeoffs over time vary from person to person in relation to stable personality traits. We investigated the influence of personality, as measured by the Five-Factor Model, on time preferences and on neural activity engaged by intertemporal choice. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants made choices between smaller-sooner and larger-later monetary rewards. For each participant, we estimated a constant-sensitivity discount function that dissociates impatience (devaluation of future consequences) from time sensitivity (consistency with rational, exponential discounting). Overall, higher neuroticism was associated with a relatively greater preference for immediate rewards and higher conscientiousness with a relatively greater preference for delayed rewards. Specifically, higher conscientiousness correlated positively with lower short-term impatience and more exponential time preferences, whereas higher neuroticism (lower emotional stability) correlated positively with higher short-term impatience and less exponential time preferences. Cognitive-control and reward brain regions were more activated when higher conscientiousness participants selected a smaller-sooner reward and, conversely, when higher neuroticism participants selected a larger-later reward. The greater activations that occurred when choosing rewards that contradicted personality predispositions may reflect the greater recruitment of mental resources needed to override those predispositions. These findings reveal that stable personality traits fundamentally influence how rewards are chosen over time.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The P300 component of the human event-related brain potential has often been linked to the processing of rare, surprising events. However, the formal computational processes underlying the generation of the P300 are not well known. Here, we formulate a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on Information Theory. Specifically, we modeled the surprise associated with the occurrence of a visual stimulus to provide a formal quantification of the ‚Äúsubjective probability‚Äù associated with an event. Subjects performed a choice reaction time task, while we recorded their brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG). In each of 12 blocks, the probabilities of stimulus occurrence were changed, thereby creating sequences of trials with low, medium, and high predictability. Trial-by-trial variations in the P300 component were best explained by a model of stimulus-bound surprise. This model accounted for the data better than a categorical model that parametrically encoded the stimulus identity, or an alternative model of surprise based on the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence. The present data demonstrate that trial-by-trial changes in P300 can be explained by predictions made by an ideal observer keeping track of the probabilities of possible events. This provides evidence for theories proposing a direct link between the P300 component and the processing of surprising events. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how model-based analyses can be used to explain significant proportions of the trial-by-trial changes in human event-related EEG responses.",

The purpose of the present study was to assess the moderating effect of two such factors: negative affect and coping drinking motives. Method Data were collected on 316 college students at a midsized public university in the upper Midwest who reported using alcohol. Results Findings indicated that both negative affect and coping drinking motives moderated the alcohol use‚Äìalcohol problems relationship. The three-way interaction indicated that the strongest relationship between alcohol use and alcohol-related problems existed for individuals high in both negative affect and coping drinking motives. Conclusions This study suggests that college students high in negative affect and coping drinking motives are particularly at risk for experiencing problems as a result of their alcohol use, indicating that clinicians should consider screening for these factors when conducting alcohol-related prevention and intervention efforts.",

A learning disability (LD) was present in 70% of the children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with a learning disability in written expression two times more common (65%) than a learning disability in reading, math, or spelling. Children with LD and ADHD had more severe learning problems than children who had LD but no ADHD, and the former also had more severe attention problems than children who had ADHD but no LD. Further, children with ADHD but no LD had some degree of learning problem, and children with LD but no ADHD had some degree of attention problem. Results suggest that learning and attention problems are on a continuum, are interrelated, and usually coexist.",

The present investigation examined the association of work-related skills to academic outcomes at the beginning of kindergarten and at the end of second grade as well as characteristics of children with low work-related skills. Children were selected from a sample of 540 children based on low work-related skills scores on the Cooper-Farran Behavioral Rating Scales, a teacher-rated scale. Results indicated that work-related skills predicted unique variance in academic outcomes at school entry and at the end of second grade, after controlling for kindergarten academic score and important background variables. In addition, children with poor work-related skills (n = 82) were found to differ from the overall sample on a number of child, family, and sociocultural variables including: significantly lower IQs, more behavior difficulties, and more medical problems, such as hearing and language problems. Finally, children with low work-related skills scored lower on academic outcomes at the beginning of kindergarten and at the end of second grade. Findings highlight the importance of early work-related skills in understanding successful school transition and early academic achievement.",

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching ¬Ω of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. ‚ÄúStatistical significance‚Äù plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental ‚Äúcuteness‚Äù and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.",

The magnitude of this streak selection bias generally decreases as the sequence gets longer, but increases in streak length, and remains substantial for a range of sequence lengths often used in empirical work. We observe that the canonical study in the influential hot hand fallacy literature, along with replications, are vulnerable to the bias. Upon correcting for the bias, we find that the longstanding conclusions of the canonical study are reversed.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental task in neuroscience is to characterize the brain‚Äôs developmental course. While replicable group-level models of structural brain development from childhood to adulthood have recently been identified, we have yet to quantify and understand individual differences in structural brain development. The present study examined inter-individual variability and sex differences in changes in brain structure, as assessed by anatomical MRI, across ages 8.0‚Äì26.0 years in 269 participants (149 females) with three time points of data (807 scans), drawn from three longitudinal datasets collected in the Netherlands, Norway, and USA. We further investigated the relationship between overall brain size and developmental changes, as well as how females and males differed in change variability across development. There was considerable inter-individual variability in the magnitude of changes observed for all examined brain measures. The majority of individuals demonstrated decreases in total gray matter volume, cortex volume, mean cortical thickness, and white matter surface area in mid-adolescence, with more variability present during the transition into adolescence and the transition into early adulthood. While most individuals demonstrated increases in white matter volume in early adolescence, this shifted to a majority demonstrating stability starting in mid-to-late adolescence. We observed sex differences in these patterns, and also an association between the size of an individual‚Äôs brain structure and the overall rate of change for the structure. The present study provides new insight as to the amount of individual variance in changes in structural morphometrics from late childhood to early adulthood in order to obtain a more nuanced picture of brain development. The observed individual- and sex-differences in brain changes also highlight the importance of further studying individual variation in developmental patterns in healthy, at-risk, and clinical populations.",

            "abstract": "Recent EEG studies have shown that implicit learning involving specific cortical circuits results in an enduring local trace manifested as local changes in spectral power. Here we used a well characterized visual sequence learning task and high density-(hd-)EEG recording to determine whether also declarative learning leaves a post-task, local change in the resting state oscillatory activity in the areas involved in the learning process. Thus, we recorded hd-EEG in normal subjects before, during and after the acquisition of the order of a fixed spatial target sequence (VSEQ) and during the presentation of targets in random order (VRAN). We first determined the temporal evolution of spectral changes during VSEQ and compared it to VRAN. We found significant differences in the alpha and theta bands in three main scalp regions, a right occipito-parietal (ROP), an anterior-frontal (AFr), and a right frontal (RFr) area. The changes in frontal theta power during VSEQ were positively correlated with the learning rate. Further, post-learning EEG recordings during resting state revealed a significant increase in alpha power in ROP relative to a pre-learning baseline. We conclude that declarative learning is associated with alpha and theta changes in frontal and posterior regions that occur during the task, and with an increase of alpha power in the occipito-parietal region after the task. These post-task changes may represent a trace of learning and a hallmark of use-dependent plasticity.",

            "abstract": "In this brief review, we describe current computational models of drug-use and addiction that fall into 2 broad categories: mathematically based models that rely on computational theories, and brain-based models that link computations to brain areas or circuits. Across categories, many are models of learning and decision-making, which may be compromised in addiction. Several mathematical models take predictive coding approaches, focusing on Bayesian prediction error. Other models focus on learning processes and (traditional) prediction error. Brain-based models have incorporated prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and the dopamine system, based on the effects of drugs on dopamine, motivation, and executive control circuits. Several models specifically describe how behavioral control may transition from habitual to goal-directed systems, consistent with computational accounts of compromised ‚Äômodel-based‚Äô control. Some brain-based models have linked this to the transition of behavioral control from ventral to dorsal striatum. Overall, we propose that while computational models capture some aspects of addiction and have advanced our thinking, most have focused on the effects of drug use rather than addiction per se, most have not been tested on and/or supported by human data, and few capture multiple stages and symptoms of addiction. We conclude by suggesting a path forward for computational models of addiction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Emotion dysregulation is thought to be critical to the development of negative psychological outcomes. Gross (1998b) conceptualized the timing of regulation strategies as key to this relationship, with response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression, as less effective and more detrimental compared to antecedent-focused ones, such as cognitive reappraisal. In the current study, we examined the relationship between reappraisal and expressive suppression and measures of psychopathology, particularly for stress-related reactions, in both undergraduate and trauma-exposed community samples of women. Generally, expressive suppression was associated with higher, and reappraisal with lower, self-reported stress-related symptoms. In particular, expressive suppression was associated with PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms in the trauma-exposed community sample, with rumination partially mediating this association. Finally, based on factor analysis, expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal appear to be independent constructs. Overall, expressive suppression, much more so than cognitive reappraisal, may play an important role in the experience of stress-related symptoms. Further, given their independence, there are potentially relevant clinical implications, as interventions that shift one of these emotion regulation strategies may not lead to changes in the other.",

            "abstract": "EEG provides a rich measure of brain activity that can be characterized as neuronal oscillations. However, most developmental EEG work to date has focused on analyzing EEG data as Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) or power based on the Fourier transform. While these measures have been productive, they do not leverage all the information contained within the EEG signal. Namely, ERP analyses ignore non-phase-locked signals and Fourier-based power analyses ignore temporal information. Time-frequency analyses can better characterize the oscillations contained in the EEG data. By separating power and phase information across different frequencies, time-frequency measures provide a closer interpretation of the neurophysiological mechanisms, facilitate translation across neurophysiology disciplines, and capture processes not observed by ERP or Fourier-based analyses (e.g., connectivity). Despite their unique contributions, a literature review of this journal reveals that time-frequency analyses of EEG are yet to be embraced by the developmental cognitive neuroscience field. This manuscript presents a conceptual introduction to time-frequency analyses for developmental researchers. To facilitate the use of time-frequency analyses, we include a tutorial of accessible scripts, based on Cohen (2014), to calculate time-frequency power (signal strength), inter-trial phase synchrony (signal consistency), and two types of phase-based connectivity (inter-channel phase synchrony and weighted phase lag index).",

            "abstract": "Interval estimates ‚Äì estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty ‚Äì have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 %) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.",

Within this setting, advocates of leaveone-out cross-validation and Bayes factors disagree on precisely which prediction problem model selection questions should aim to answer. In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might ‚Äútoy problems‚Äù tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns? I do not offer answers to these questions, but hope to highlight the reasons why psychological researchers cannot avoid asking them.",

In this brief article I discuss one counterexample: Shepard‚Äôs law of generalization and the various Bayesian extensions that it inspired over the past 3 decades. Using Shepard‚Äôs law as a running example, I argue that psychological theory building is not a statistical problem, mathematical formalism is beneficial to theory, measurement and theory have a complex relationship, rewriting old theory can yield new insights, and theory growth can drive empirical work. Although I generally suggest that the tools of mathematical psychology are valuable to psychological theorists, I also comment on some limitations to this approach.",

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes‚Äîa process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.",

Fitting response time and accuracy to a drift-diffusion model produces evidence accumulation rate and non-decision time parameter estimates that reflect cognitive processes. Our goal is to elucidate the effect of attention on visual decision making. In this study, we show that measures of attention obtained from simultaneous EEG recordings can explain per-trial evidence accumulation rates and perceptual preprocessing times during a visual decision making task. Models assuming linear relationships between diffusion model parameters and EEG measures as external inputs were fit in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The EEG measures were features of the evoked potential (EP) to the onset of a masking noise and the onset of a task-relevant signal stimulus. Single-trial evoked EEG responses, P200s to the onsets of visual noise and N200s to the onsets of visual signal, explain single-trial evidence accumulation and preprocessing times. Within-trial evidence accumulation variance was not found to be influenced by attention to the signal or noise. Single-trial measures of attention lead to better out-of-sample predictions of accuracy and correct reaction time distributions for individual subjects.",

            "abstract": "A worrying number of psychological findings are not replicable. Diagnoses of the causes of this ‚Äúreplication crisis,‚Äù and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors‚Äîthat is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the ‚Äúreplication crisis,‚Äù including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.",

For frequentist mixed models, previous research showed that excluding random slopes‚Äîdifferences between individuals in the direction and size of an effect‚Äîfrom a model when they are in the data can lead to a substantial increase in false-positive conclusions in null-hypothesis tests. Here, I demonstrated through five simulations that the same is true for Bayesian hypothesis testing with mixed models, which often yield Bayes factors reflecting very strong evidence for a mean effect on the population level even if there was no such effect. Including random slopes in the model largely eliminates the risk of strong false positives but reduces the chance of obtaining strong evidence for true effects. I recommend starting analysis by testing the support for random slopes in the data and removing them from the models only if there is clear evidence against them.",

            "abstract": "Accessible summary Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex disorder that is difficult to treat. Five psychotherapeutic approaches are used in the management of BPD. These include cognitive behavioural therapy, mentalization-based therapy, schema-focused therapy, transference-focused therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Of the five approaches used to manage BPD, DBT has been studied the most extensively. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a multi-pronged approach comprising of skills-based training, individual psychotherapy, telephone calls and consultation team meetings. DBT can have a positive effect on therapists, shifting therapeutic pessimism towards one of optimism with DBT therapists also describing personal changes resulting from their work with clients. A considerable number of trials have been conducted as DBT was developed in the early 1990s, and most support the usefulness of BPD in the treatment of BPD. However, two Cochrane reviews conclude that more research is needed to provide stronger evidence in support of DBT for the management of BPD. Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex disorder that is difficult to treat. However, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan in the early 1990s, has emerged as a promising treatment option for those diagnosed with BPD. DBT is a multi-pronged treatment approach delivered normally in outpatient settings over 12 months and requires highly skilled and trained therapists. Many trials have provided evidence to support the use of DBT in the treatment of BPD. However, outcome measures vary and are mostly limited to measurable behavioural outcomes such as incidences of deliberate self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Two recent Cochrane reviews conclude that DBT does benefit those with BPD, but more robust evidence is needed. DBT training for health care professionals also has the potential to shift health care professionals‚Äô attitudes from one of therapeutic pessimism to one of optimism.",

However, because of strong incentives for innovation and weak incentives for confirmation, direct replication is rarely practiced or published. The Reproducibility Project is an open, large-scale, collaborative effort to systematically examine the rate and predictors of reproducibility in psychological science. So far, 72 volunteer researchers from 41 institutions have organized to openly and transparently replicate studies published in three prominent psychological journals in 2008. Multiple methods will be used to evaluate the findings, calculate an empirical rate of replication, and investigate factors that predict reproducibility.

            "abstract": "The idea that in behavioral research everything correlates with everything else was a niche area of the scientific literature for more than half a century. With the increasing availability of large data sets in psychology, the ‚Äúcrud‚Äù factor has, however, become more relevant than ever before. When referenced in empirical work, it is often used by researchers to discount minute‚Äîbut statistically significant‚Äîeffects that are deemed too small to be considered meaningful. This review tracks the history of the crud factor and examines how its use in the psychological- and behavioral-science literature has developed to this day. We highlight a common and deep-seated lack of understanding about what the crud factor is and discuss whether it can be proven to exist or estimated and how it should be interpreted. This lack of understanding makes the crud factor a convenient tool for psychologists to use to disregard unwanted results, even though the presence of a crud factor should be a large inconvenience for the discipline. To inspire a concerted effort to take the crud factor more seriously, we clarify the definitions of important concepts, highlight current pitfalls, and pose questions that need to be addressed to ultimately improve understanding of the crud factor. Such work will be necessary to develop the crud factor into a useful concept encouraging improved psychological research.",

A confluence of findings from neuroimaging, physiological, neuropathological, and neuropsychological studies of alcoholics indicate that the frontal lobes, limbic system, and cerebellum are particularly vulnerable to damage and dysfunction. An integrative approach employing a variety of neuroscientific technologies is essential for recognizing the interconnectivity of the different functional systems affected by alcoholism.

            "abstract": "Long-term chronic alcoholism is associated with disparate and widespread residual consequences for brain functioning and behavior, and alcoholics suffer a variety of cognitive deficiencies and emotional abnormalities. Alcoholism has heterogeneous origins and outcomes, depending upon factors such as family history, age, gender, and mental or physical health. Consequently, the neuropsychological profiles associated with alcoholism are not uniform among individuals. Moreover, within and across research studies, variability among participants is substantial and contributes to characteristics associated with differential treatment outcomes after detoxification. In order to refine our understanding of alcoholism-related impaired, spared, and recovered abilities, we focus on five specific functional domains: (1) memory, (2) executive functions, (3) emotion and psychosocial skills, (4) visuospatial cognition, and (5) psychomotor abilities. The brain systems that are most vulnerable to alcoholism are the frontocerebellar and mesocorticolimbic circuitries. Over time, with abstinence from alcohol, the brain appears to become reorganized to provide compensation for structural and behavioral deficits. By relying on a combination of clinical and scientific approaches, future research will help to refine the compensatory roles of healthy brain systems, the degree to which abstinence and treatment facilitate the reversal of brain atrophy and dysfunction, and the importance of individual differences to outcome.",

            "abstract": "In light of psychology‚Äôs ‚Äútheory crisis‚Äù, multiple authors have argued that adopting formalization and/or formal modelling would constitute a useful or even necessary step towards stronger psychological theory. In this article, I instead argue that formal modelling cannot solve the core problem the psychological ‚Äútheory crisis‚Äù refers to, which are the currently high degrees of contrastive and holistic underdetermination of our theories by our data. I do so by first introducing underdetermination as an explanatory framework for determining the evidential import of research findings for theories, and showing how both broader theoretical considerations and informal assumptions are key to this process. Then, I derive the aforementioned core problem from the current ‚Äútheory crisis‚Äù literature and tentatively explore its possible solutions. Lastly, I show that formal modelling is neither a necessary nor sufficient solution for either contrastive or holistic underdetermination, and that its uncritical adoption might instead worsen the crisis.",

            "abstract": "The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.",

            "abstract": "This special issue explores the growing intersection between mathematical psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Mathematical psychology, and cognitive modeling more generally, has a rich history of formalizing and testing hypotheses about cognitive mechanisms within a mathematical and computational language, making exquisite predictions of how people perceive, learn, remember, and decide. Cognitive neuroscience aims to identify neural mechanisms associated with key aspects of cognition using techniques like neurophysiology, electrophysiology, and structural and functional brain imaging. These two come together in a powerful new approach called model-based cognitive neuroscience, which can both inform cognitive modeling and help to interpret neural measures. Cognitive models decompose complex behavior into representations and processes and these latent model states can be used to explain the modulation of brain states under different experimental conditions. Reciprocally, neural measures provide data that help constrain cognitive models and adjudicate between competing cognitive models that make similar predictions about behavior. As examples, brain measures are related to cognitive model parameters fitted to individual participant data, measures of brain dynamics are related to measures of model dynamics, model parameters are constrained by neural measures, model parameters or model states are used in statistical analyses of neural data, or neural and behavioral data are analyzed jointly within a hierarchical modeling framework. We provide an introduction to the field of model-based cognitive neuroscience and to the articles contained within this special issue.",

DBT was only marginally better than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing attrition during treatment in five RCTs (pooled risk difference ?0.168). DBT was not significantly different from TAU in reducing depression symptoms in three RCTs (pooled Hedges? g ?0.896).Discussion:DBT demonstrates efficacy in stabilizing and controlling self-destructive behavior and improving patient compliance.",

            "abstract": "Only a small proportion of individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) will convert to dementia. Methods currently available to identify risk for conversion do not combine enough sensitivity and specificity, which is even more problematic in low-educated populations. Current guidelines suggest the use of combined markers for dementia to enhance the prediction accuracy of assessment methods. The present study adhered to this proposal and investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the electrophysiological component P300 and standard neuropsychological tests to assess patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and MCI recruited from a low-income country. The neuropsychological battery comprised tests of memory, attention, language, praxis, and executive functions. The P300 was recorded using a classical visual odd-ball paradigm. Three variables were found to achieve sensitivity and specificity values above 80% (Immediate and Delayed recall of word list ‚Äì CERAD ‚Äì and the latency of P300) for both MCI and AD. When they entered the model together (i.e., combined approach) the sensitivity for MCI increased to 96% and the specificity remained high (80%). Our preliminary findings suggest that the combined use of sensitive neuropsychological tasks and the analysis of the P300 may offer a very useful method for the preclinical assessment of AD, particularly in populations with low socioeconomic and educational levels. Our results provide a platform and justification to employ more resources to convert P300 and related parameters into a biological marker for AD.",

            "abstract": "Recent scientific initiatives have called for increased use of neurobiological variables in clinical and other applied assessments. However, the task of incorporating neural measures into psychological assessments entails significant methodological challenges that have not been effectively addressed to date. As result, neurophysiological measures remain underutilized in clinical and applied assessments, and formal procedures for integrating such measures with report-based measures are lacking. In this paper, we discuss major methodological issues that have impeded progress in this direction, and propose a systematic research strategy for integrating neurophysiological measures into psychological assessment protocols. The strategy we propose is an iterative psychoneurometric approach that provides a means to establish multi-method (MM) measurement models for core biobehavioral traits that influence functioning across diverse areas of life. We provide a detailed illustration of a MM model for one such trait, inhibitory control (inhibition-disinhibition), and highlight work being done to develop counterpart models for other biobehavioral traits (i.e., threat sensitivity, reward sensitivity, affiliative capacity). We discuss how these measurement models can be refined and extended through use of already existing datasets, and outline steps that can be taken to establish norms for MM assessments and optimize the feasibility of their use in everyday practice. We believe this model-oriented strategy can provide a viable pathway toward effective use of neurophysiological measures in routine clinical assessments.",

            "abstract": "Addiction is a chronic compulsion and relapsing disorder. It involves several brain areas and circuits, which encode vary functions such as reward, motivation, and memory. Drug addiction is defined as a ‚Äúpathological pattern of use of a substance‚Äù, characterized by the loss of control on drug-taking-related behaviors, the pursuance of those behaviors even in the presence of negative consequences, and a strong motivated activity to assume substances. Three different theories guide experimental research on drug addiction. Each of these theories consider singles features, such as an aberrant motivation, a hedonic dysregulation, and an aberrant habit learning as the main actor to explain the entire process of the addictive behaviors. The major goal of this study is to present a new hypotheses of transitionality from a controlled use to abuse of addictive substances trough the overview of the three different theories, considering all the single features of each single theory together on the same ‚Äútemporal continuum‚Äù from use to abuse of addictive substances. Recently, it has been suggested that common neural systems may be activated by natural and pharmacological stimuli, raising the hypotheses that binge-eating disorders could be considered as addictive behaviors. The second goal of this study is to present evidences in order to highlight a possible psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and ‚Äúfood addiction‚Äù. Finally, interesting questions are brought up starting from last findings about a theoretical/psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and ‚Äúfood addiction‚Äù and their possibly same transitionality along the same ‚Äútemporal continuum‚Äù from use to abuse of addictive substances in order to investigate new therapeutic strategies based on new therapeutic strategies based on the individual moments characterizing the transition from the voluntary intake of substances to the maladaptive addictive behavior.",

            "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely included in large-scale studies. This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to pool data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the functionality of Automagic and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.",

            "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with considerable impairment in psychiatric and functional domains. Although stimulant medication can reduce core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, a subgroup of patients does not respond to this intervention. A precision medicine approach has been proposed, whereby biomarkers are used to identify an effective treatment approach for a given individual. This review synthesizes the existing literature on event-related potential (ERP) correlates of stimulant response in children diagnosed with ADHD, with the goal of evaluating the potential for ERP to inform precision medicine care in this population. Forty-three articles were examined and results tentatively suggest that stimulant medications normalize the amplitude of the P300 component, and this is also associated with behavioral improvement. In contrast, results generally indicate that stimulants do not significantly alter early processing components, although there are some exceptions to this finding. Implications for research, theory, and clinical work are considered and concrete recommendations for future directions are provided. While recognizing limitations of existing literature (e.g., homogenous samples, variable methodologies), we conclude that ERP methods represent a promising approach for precision medicine care of patients with ADHD.",

            "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with considerable impairment in psychiatric and functional domains. Although stimulant medication can reduce core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, a subgroup of patients does not respond to this intervention. A precision medicine approach has been proposed, whereby biomarkers are used to identify an effective treatment approach for a given individual. This review synthesizes the existing literature on event-related potential (ERP) correlates of stimulant response in children diagnosed with ADHD, with the goal of evaluating the potential for ERP to inform precision medicine care in this population. Forty-three articles were examined and results tentatively suggest that stimulant medications normalize the amplitude of the P300 component, and this is also associated with behavioral improvement. In contrast, results generally indicate that stimulants do not significantly alter early processing components, although there are some exceptions to this finding. Implications for research, theory, and clinical work are considered and concrete recommendations for future directions are provided. While recognizing limitations of existing literature (e.g., homogenous samples, variable methodologies), we conclude that ERP methods represent a promising approach for precision medicine care of patients with ADHD.",

            "abstract": "Social sciences are facing a crisis of replicability, and concerns about the confidence in quantitative findings have resulted in an increasing interest in open science practices across many fields. In this article we introduce scholars of (digital) journalism studies and communication science to multiverse analysis while addressing the possible reasons of heterogeneity in the findings of research on engagement with news on social media. Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.",

The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations.",

            "abstract": "A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is deciphering the representational schemes of the brain. Stimulusfeature-based encoding models are becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid because successful prediction can occur even if the two representational spaces use different, but correlated, representational schemes. We support this claim with three simulations in which we achieved high prediction accuracy despite systematic differences in the geometries and dimensions of the underlying representations. Detailed analysis of the encoding models‚Äô predictions showed systematic deviations from ground-truth, indicating that high prediction accuracy is insufficient for making representational inferences. This fallacy applies to the prediction of actual neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations, including model comparison, absolute model performance, visualization techniques and attentional modulation.",

            "abstract": "Reliable and valid assessment of students‚Äô academic potential has huge consequences for their future success. To date, this has almost exclusively been achieved through the administration of pencil-and-paper aptitude assessments or self-report instruments. Performance on these assessments can be influenced by factors such as test anxiety, providing an inaccurate prediction of a student‚Äôs potential. These methods also ignore that academic performance is the product of brain activity. Limits associated with these past practices can be addressed through the identification of robust neuromarkers of academic performance. The P3 component of the event-related potential, thought to index cognitive processes underlying learning, is one such promising candidate. Previous studies have identified significant associations between temporal characteristics of the P3 and a number of academic performance measures, highlighting its utility as a neuromarker. This brief review summarizes previous work on the P3 component and academic performance, and outlines considerations for future research.",

            "abstract": "Time of day (TOD) influences on executive functions have been widely reported, with greater efficiency demonstrated at optimal relative to non-optimal TOD according to one‚Äôs chronotype (i.e., synchrony effect). Older adults (OAs) show declines in inhibitory control and are more sensitive to the effects of circadian variation on executive functioning. To date, no studies have investigated the effects of TOD and aging on executive functioning using electrophysiological measures. The present study investigated the effects of aging and TOD on the neural correlates of inhibitory processing (N2 and P3) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Go-NoGo and Flanker tasks were administered to 52 OAs of morning chronotype and 51 younger adults (YAs) of afternoon-to-evening chronotype who were randomly assigned to morning or afternoon test sessions, with the optimal TOD for OAs in the morning and for YAs in the afternoon/evening. While behavioral results demonstrated no TOD effects, ERPs indicated synchrony effects. Both YAs and OAs showed greater modulation of Go-NoGo N2 and greater P3 amplitude during the non-optimal than optimal TOD, consistent with the synchrony effect. For the Flanker task, age differences in P3 amplitude were only apparent during the non-optimal TOD. These results suggest that processes associated with inhibitory control are differentially affected by TOD and aging, with age-related reductions in inhibitory efficiency during off-peak test times on measures of interference control. These findings highlight the sensitivity of ERPs to detect TOD effects in the absence of behavioral differences, confirm more pronounced TOD effects in OAs relative to YAs on ERP measures of interference control, and reinforce the need to assess and control for circadian typology in research studies.",

Despite the prevalence and influence of the context updating hypothesis, direct empirical support for the role of WM updating in eliciting the P3b is still missing. The present study was designed to address the empirical gap in understanding the functional role of P3b in general, and specifically in relation to WM updating. A mass-univariate approach was used to test the unique contribution of WM updating, categorization, and stimulus probability to the P3b. The results indicated that the P3b is only modulated by the categorization process, a finding that challenges the WM updating hypothesis. Taken together these results, we suggest that the P3b reflects a WM guided target identification mechanism, which operates as part of a goal-directed learning strategy.",

            "abstract": "The P3 component (P300, P3b) is considered to be an effective index of attention and categorization processes when elicited in a visual oddball task, specifically reflecting the selection of a rare target item among frequent non-targets. Researchers have proposed that target categorization is guided by representations of target features held in working memory (WM), thus guiding attention and categorization processes to distinguish targets from non-targets. Although WM is theorized to have visuospatial, verbal and executive function components, most studies do not investigate how these WM components contribute to the P3. This study uses an individual differences approach to determine whether correlations between WM capabilities and P3 amplitudes indicate a common underlying cognitive construct. Participants (n¬†=¬†140) completed an 80/20 visual oddball task to elicit the P3 as well as independent visual working memory (VWM), spatial working memory (SPWM), and executive function (task switching (TS) and digit symbol substitution (DSS)) tests. Results indicated that measures of executive function, DSS and TS, but not VWM or SPWM ability, correlated with and predicted faster task response times and greater P3 amplitudes. RT and WM measures were not correlated with P3 fractional area latencies. These results support context updating theory. Executive function WM availability, whether as a property of the participant‚Äôs processing system or based on task demands, plays a functional role in the P3 and an important role in efficient visual categorization and goal-directed learning.",

            "abstract": "This article provides an overview of P300 research from infancy through adolescence. First, a brief historical overview is provided highlighting seminal studies that began exploration of the P300 component in developmental groups. Overall, these studies suggest that the P300 can be detected in children and appears to reflect similar cognitive processes to those in adults; however, it is significantly delayed in its latency to peak. Second, two striking findings from developmental research are the lack of a clear P300 component in infancy and differential electrophysiological responses to novel, unexpected stimuli in children, adolescents, and adults. Third, contemporary questions are described, which include P300-like components in infancy, alteration of P300 in atypically developing groups, relations between P300 and behavior, individual differences of P300, and neural substrates of P300 across development. Finally, we conclude with comments regarding the power of a developmental perspective and suggestions for important issues that should be addressed in the next 50 years of P300 research.",

Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl‚Äôs criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.",

This research program moves away from the disorder-based ‚Äúone-model-fits-all‚Äù approach to treating mental disorders, and adopts the network approach to psychopathology as its foundation of research. Its core assumption is that dynamically interacting symptoms constitute the disorder. Our goal is to further develop the network approach by studying (1) dynamic networks of symptoms and other variables (i.e., elements) in a large number of individuals with a wide range of mental disorders from a transdiagnostic perspective (network-based diagnosis; mapping), including both Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and digital phenotyping, (2) the transdiagnostic mechanisms reflecting potential causal relations among elements of the networks by performing experimental (pre-)clinical studies (zooming), and (3) the effectiveness of personalised network-informed interventions (targeting). Challenges to overcome in this research program are discussed, which relate to data collection (e.g., selection of EMA variables) and data analyses (e.g., power considerations), the development and application of network-informed diagnoses and network-informed interventions (e.g., what characteristic(s) of the network to target in interventions), and the implementation in clinical practice (e.g., train therapists in the use of networks in therapy).",

But applied researchers may sometimes not understand the underlying causal inference problems and thus endorse conclusions that rest on unrealistic assumptions. In this article, we aim to provide a clear explanation for the limited conditions under which standard procedures for mediation and moderation analysis can succeed. We discuss why reversing arrows or comparing model fit indices cannot tell us which model is the right one and how tests of conditional independence can at least tell us where our model goes wrong. Causal modeling practices in psychology are far from optimal but may be kept alive by domain norms that demand every article makes some novel claim about processes and boundary conditions. We end with a vision for a different research culture in which causal inference is pursued in a much slower, more deliberate, and collaborative manner.",

            "abstract": "Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables‚Äîcolliders and mediators‚Äîshould not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.",

            "abstract": "A central aim of human neuroscience is understanding the neurobiology of cognition and behavior. Although we have made significant progress towards this goal, reliance on group-level studies of the developed adult brain has limited our ability to explain population variability and developmental changes in neural circuitry and behavior. In this review, we suggest that predictive modeling, a method for predicting individual differences in behavior from brain features, can complement descriptive approaches and provide new ways to account for this variability. Highlighting the outsized scientific and clinical benefits of prediction in developmental populations including adolescence, we show that predictive brain-based models are already providing new insights on adolescent-specific risk-related behaviors. Together with large-scale developmental neuroimaging datasets and complementary analytic approaches, predictive modeling affords us the opportunity and obligation to identify novel treatment targets and individually tailor the course of interventions for developmental psychopathologies that impact so many young people today.",

Although the reliability of data is a serious concern, we argue that there is a deeper and more insidious problem in the field: the persistent and dramatic misinterpretation of empirical results that replicate easily and consistently. Using a series of four highly studied ‚Äútextbook‚Äù examples from different research domains (eyewitness memory, deductive reasoning, social psychology, and child welfare), we show how simple unrecognized incompatibilities among dependent measures, analysis tools, and the properties of data can lead to fundamental interpretive errors. These errors, which are not reduced by additional data collection, may lead to misguided research efforts and policy recommendations. We conclude with a set of recommended strategies and research tools to reduce the probability of these persistent and largely unrecognized errors. The use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves is highlighted as one such recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the mechanisms of human memory is a central goal of neuroscience, both from the point of view of the fundamental biology of memory and for its translational relevance. Here, we review some contributions that recordings from neurons in humans implanted with electrodes for clinical purposes have made toward this goal. Recordings from the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, reveal the existence of two classes of cells: those encoding highly selective and invariant representations of abstract concepts, and memory-selective cells whose activity is related to familiarity and episodic retrieval. Insights derived from observing these cells in behaving humans include that semantic representations are activated before episodic representations, that memory content and memory strength are segregated, and that the activity of both types of cells is related to subjective awareness as expected from a substrate for declarative memory. Visually selective cells can remain persistently active for several seconds, thereby revealing a cellular substrate for working memory in humans. An overarching insight is that the neural code of human memory is interpretable at the single-neuron level. Jointly, intracranial recording studies are starting to reveal aspects of the building blocks of human memory at the single-cell level. This work establishes a bridge to cellular-level work in animals on the one hand, and the extensive literature on noninvasive imaging in humans on the other hand. More broadly, this work is a step toward a detailed mechanistic understanding of human memory that is needed to develop therapies for human memory disorders.",

This lack of integration across studies hampers theory building and limits a deeper understanding of underlying constructs.Methods: Five widely used and conceptually distinct measures of time perception (i.e., perceived life position, global future horizons, future orientation and planning, self-continuity, and the temporal extension of episodic future thought) were administered to a demographically stratified adult life-span sample. Theoretically implicated covariates, including cognition, current affect, personality, and subjective health, were also assessed.Results: Principle component analyses suggested a four-component solution. Perceived life position and global future horizons formed a single component reflecting subjective life span; the remaining measures each constituted separate components. The life span component and episodic future thought were negatively associated with age, self-continuity was positively associated with age, and future orientation did not vary by age. Among the covariates, mental and physical health showed the most pronounced associations with time perceptions, but the direction of effects varied across components.Conclusion: Findings suggest that mental representations of time encompass multiple components that show distinct age patterns and associations with covariates. Implications for theory building and practical applications are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Circadian rhythms have natural relative variations among humans known as chronotype. Chronotype or being a morning or evening person, has a specific physiological, behavioural, and also genetic manifestation. Whether and how chronotype modulates human brain physiology and cognition is, however, not well understood. Here we examine how cortical excitability, neuroplasticity, and cognition are associated with chronotype in early and late chronotype individuals. We monitor motor cortical excitability, brain stimulation-induced neuroplasticity, and examine motor learning and cognitive functions at circadian-preferred and non-preferred times of day in 32 individuals. Motor learning and cognitive performance (working memory, and attention) along with their electrophysiological components are significantly enhanced at the circadian-preferred, compared to the non-preferred time. This outperformance is associated with enhanced cortical excitability (prominent cortical facilitation, diminished cortical inhibition), and long-term potentiation/depression-like plasticity. Our data show convergent findings of how¬†chronotype can modulate human brain functions from basic physiological mechanisms to behaviour and higher-order cognition.",

            "abstract": "Neurocognitive impairments commonly observed in depressive disorders are thought to be reflected in reduced P300 amplitudes. To date, depression-related P300 amplitude reduction has mostly been demonstrated cross-sectionally, while its clinical implication for the course of depression remains largely unclear. Moreover, the relationship between P300 and specific clinical characteristics of depression is uncertain. To shed light on the functional significance of the P300 in depression, we examined whether initial P300 amplitude prospectively predicted changes in depressive symptoms among a community sample of 58 adults (mean age = 38.86 years old, 81% female) with a current depressive disorder. This sample was assessed at two-time points, separated by approximately nine months (range = 6.6‚Äì15.9). At the initial visit, participants completed clinical interviews, self-report measures, and a flanker task, while EEG was recorded to derive P300 amplitude. At the follow-up visit, participants again completed the same clinical interviews and self-report measures. Results indicated that a reduced P300 amplitude at the initial visit was associated with higher total depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for initial depressive symptoms. These data indicate the potential clinical utility for the P300 as a neural marker of disease course among adults with a current depressive disorder. Future research may target P300 in interventions to determine whether depression-related outcomes can be improved.",

Reprinted by permission of Basic Books, a member of The Perseus Books Group.The notion that addiction is a ‚Äúbrain disease‚Äù has become widespread and rarely challenged. The brain-disease model implies erroneously that the brain is necessarily the most important and useful level of analysis for understanding and treating addiction. This paper will explain the limits of over-medicalizing ‚Äì while acknowledging a legitimate place for medication in the therapeutic repertoire ‚Äì and why a broader perspective on the problems of the addicted person is essential to understanding addiction and to providing optimal care. In short, the brain-disease model obscures the dimension of choice in addiction, the capacity to respond to incentives, and also the essential fact people use drugs for reasons (as consistent with a self-medication hypothesis). The latter becomes obvious when patients become abstinent yet still struggle to assume rewarding lives in the realm of work and relationships. Thankfully, addicts can choose to recover and are not helpless victims of their own ‚Äúhijacked brains.‚Äù",

            "abstract": "Individual differences in processing speed are consistently related to individual differences in cognitive abilities, but the mechanisms through which a higher processing speed facilitates reasoning remain largely unknown. To identify these mechanisms, researchers have been using latencies of the event-related potential (ERP) to study how the speed of cognitive processes associated with specific ERP components is related to cognitive abilities. Although there is some evidence that latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes are related to intelligence, results are overall quite inconsistent. These inconsistencies likely result from variations in analytic procedures and little consideration of the psychometric properties of ERP latencies in relatively small sample studies. Here we used a multiverse approach to evaluate how different analytical choices regarding references, low-pass filter cutoffs, and latency measures affect the psychometric properties of P2, N2, and P3 latencies and their relations with cognitive abilities in a sample of 148 participants. Latent correlations between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities ranged from ‚àí.49 to ‚àí.78. ERP latency measures contained about equal parts of measurement error variance and systematic variance, and only about half of the systematic variance was related to cognitive abilities, whereas the other half reflected nuisance factors. We recommend addressing these problematic psychometric properties by recording EEG data from multiple tasks and modeling relations between ERP latencies and covariates in latent variable models. All in all, our results indicate that there is a substantial and robust relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities when those issues are addressed.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has shown that individuals with greater cognitive abilities display a greater speed of higher-order cognitive processing. These results suggest that speeded neural information processing may facilitate evidence accumulation during decision making and memory updating and thus yield advantages in general cognitive abilities. We used a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to test the hypothesis that individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation mediate the relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities. We found that a higher neural speed predicted both the velocity of evidence accumulation across behavioral tasks and cognitive ability test scores. However, only a negligible part of the association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities was mediated by individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation. The model demonstrated impressive forecasting abilities by predicting 36% of individual variation in cognitive ability test scores in an entirely new sample solely based on their electrophysiological and behavioral data. Our results suggest that individual differences in neural processing speed might affect a plethora of higher-order cognitive processes, that only in concert explain the large association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities, instead of the effect being entirely explained by differences in evidence accumulation speeds.",

            "abstract": "A number of developmental theories have been proposed that make differential predictions about the links between age and temporal discounting, or the devaluation of future rewards. Most empirical studies examining adult age differences in temporal discounting have relied on economic intertemporal choice tasks, which pit choosing a smaller, sooner monetary reward against choosing a larger, later one. Although initial studies using these tasks suggested older adults discount less than younger adults, follow-up studies provided heterogeneous, and thus inconclusive, results. Using an open science approach, we test the replicability of adult age differences in temporal discounting by conducting a preregistered systematic literature search and meta-analysis of adult age differences in intertemporal choice tasks. Across 37 cross-sectional studies (Total N = 104,737), a planned meta-analysis found no sizeable relation between age and temporal discounting, r = ‚àí0.068, 95% CI [‚àí0.170, 0.035]. We also found little evidence of publication bias or p-hacking. Exploratory analyses of moderators found no effect of research design (e.g., extreme-group vs. continuous age), incentives (hypothetical vs. real rewards), duration of delay (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years), or quantification of discounting behavior (e.g., proportion of immediate choices vs. parameters from computational modeling). Additional analyses of 12 participant-level data sets found little support for a nonlinear relation between age and temporal discounting across adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that younger, middle-aged, and older adults show similar preferences for smaller, sooner over larger, later rewards. We provide recommendations for future empirical work on temporal discounting across the adult life span. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists? nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (‚â§ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.",

            "abstract": "Stress is a well-known risk factor in the development of addiction and in addiction relapse vulnerability. A series of population-based and epidemiological studies have identified specific stressors and individual-level variables that are predictive of substance use and abuse. Preclinical research also shows that stress exposure enhances drug self-administration and reinstates drug seeking in drug-experienced animals. The deleterious effects of early life stress, child maltreatment, and accumulated adversity on alterations in the corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (CRF/HPA), the extrahypothalamic CRF, the autonomic arousal, and the central noradrenergic systems are also presented. The effects of these alterations on the corticostriatal-limbic motivational, learning, and adaptation systems that include mesolimbic dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) pathways are discussed as the underlying pathophysiology associated with stress-related risk of addiction. The effects of regular and chronic drug use on alterations in these stress and motivational systems are also reviewed, with specific attention to the impact of these adaptations on stress regulation, impulse control, and perpetuation of compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility. Finally, research gaps in furthering our understanding of the association between stress and addiction are presented, with the hope that addressing these unanswered questions will significantly influence new prevention and treatment strategies to address vulnerability to addiction.",

            "abstract": "Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with changes in stress and reward pathways that could alter vulnerability to emotional stress and alcohol craving. This study examines whether chronic alcohol abuse is associated with altered stress and alcohol craving responses. Treatment-engaged, 28-day abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals (ADs; 6F/22M), and social drinkers (SDs; 10F/18M) were exposed to a brief guided imagery of a personalized stressful, alcohol-related and neutral-relaxing situation, one imagery condition per session, presented in random order across 3 days. Alcohol craving, anxiety and emotion ratings, behavioral distress responses, heart rate, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol measures were assessed. Alcohol patients showed significantly elevated basal heart rate and salivary cortisol levels. Stress and alcohol cue exposure each produced a significantly enhanced and persistent craving state in alcohol patients that was marked by increased anxiety, negative emotion, systolic blood pressure responses, and, in the case of alcohol cue, behavioral distress responses, as compared to SDs. Blunted stress-induced cortisol responses were observed in the AD compared to the SD group. These data are the first to document that stress and cue exposure induce a persistent negative emotion-related alcohol craving state in abstinent alcoholics accompanied by dysregulated HPA and physiological arousal responses. As laboratory models of stress and negative mood-induced alcohol craving are predictive of relapse outcomes, one implication of the current data is that treatments targeting decreases in stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and regulation of stress responses could be of benefit in improving alcohol relapse outcomes.",

            "abstract": "The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.",

            "abstract": "The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7‚Äì9 years), young adults (18‚Äì30 years), and older adults (65‚Äì76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.",

Here, we applied a multiverse analysis to a single dataset - effectively sampling 14 out of 864 possible pre-processing and analysis pipelines which were selected to cover the full range of variability found in the literature using systematic review approach (≈†o≈°kiƒá et al., 2021). In this large reproducibility project, an ERP N400 dataset was donated by an independent research team, and the 14 selected pipelines were applied to this dataset to compare study outcomes, descriptive statistics, effect size, data quality, and statistical power. Out of the steps that were varied, high-pass filter cut-off, artifact removal method, baseline duration, reference, measurement latency and locations, and amplitude measure (peak vs. mean) were all shown to affect the study outcome parameters. Low-pass filtering was the only step which did not notably influence any of these parameters. In short, this study shows that even some of the seemingly minor procedural deviations can influence conclusions of an ERP study and demonstrates the power of the multiverse analysis approach in both identifying the most reliable effects and providing concrete insights into consequences of a given methodological decision.",

The architecture of these brain networks can be examined and analyzed with a large variety of graph theory tools. Methods for detecting modules, or network communities, are of particular interest because they uncover major building blocks or subnetworks that are particularly densely connected, often corresponding to specialized functional components. A large number of methods for community detection have become available and are now widely applied in network neuroscience. This article first surveys a number of these methods, with an emphasis on their advantages and shortcomings; then it summarizes major findings on the existence of modules in both structural and functional brain networks and briefly considers their potential functional roles in brain evolution, wiring minimization, and the emergence of functional specialization and complex dynamics.",

In this review, we integrate recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of human memory retrieval, pinpointing the neural chronometry underlying successful recall. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that sensory cues proceed into the medial temporal lobe within the first 500¬†ms. At this point, a hippocampal process sets in, geared toward internal pattern completion and coordination of cortical memory reinstatement between 500 and 1500¬†ms. We further highlight the dynamic principles governing the recall process, which include a reversal of perceptual information flows, temporal compression, and theta clocking.",

            "abstract": "Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.",

            "abstract": "The neural correlates of memory formation in humans have long been investigated by exposing subjects to diverse material and comparing responses to items later remembered to those forgotten. Tasks requiring memorization of sensory sequences afford unique possibilities for linking neural memorization processes to behavior, because, rather than comparing across different items of varying content, each individual item can be examined across the successive learning states of being initially unknown, newly learned, and eventually, fully known. Sequence learning paradigms have not yet been exploited in this way, however. Here, we analyze the event-related potentials of subjects attempting to memorize sequences of visual locations over several blocks of repeated observation, with respect to pre- and post-block recall tests. Over centro-parietal regions, we observed a rapid P300 component superimposed on a broader positivity, which exhibited distinct modulations across learning states that were replicated in two separate experiments. Consistent with its well-known encoding of surprise, the P300 deflection monotonically decreased over blocks as locations became better learned and hence more expected. In contrast, the broader positivity was especially elevated at the point when a given item was newly learned, i.e., started being successfully recalled. These results implicate the Broad Positivity in endogenously-driven, intentional memory formation, whereas the P300, in processing the current stimulus to the degree that it was previously uncertain, indexes the cumulative knowledge thereby gained. The decreasing surprise/P300 effect significantly predicted learning success both across blocks and across subjects. This presents a new, neural-based means to evaluate learning capabilities independent of verbal reports, which could have considerable value in distinguishing genuine learning disabilities from difficulties to communicate the outcomes of learning, or perceptual impairments, in a range of clinical brain disorders.",

Previous ERP research methods had the limitation that their design did not allow to track the gradual memory formation process. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which aging affects learning are still unknown. By using a visual sequence learning task, which consists of the repeated presentation of a simple sequence of tokens, we are able to track the progress of gradual memory formation through both neurophysiological and behavioral markers. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning related centroparietal ERP components: the P300 and broad positivity.",

However, an increasing number of scientists are going in the opposite direction by utilizing opaque machine learning models to make predictions and draw inferences, suggesting that scientists are opting for models that have less potential for understanding. Are scientists trading understanding for some other epistemic or pragmatic good when they choose a machine learning model? Or are the assumptions behind why minimal models provide understanding misguided? In this paper, using the case of deep neural networks, I argue that it is not the complexity or black box nature of a model that limits how much understanding the model provides. Instead, it is a lack of scientific and empirical evidence supporting the link that connects a model to the target phenomenon that primarily prohibits understanding.",

Good theories are those that help facilitate this process by being hard-to-vary: they explain what they are supposed to explain, they are consistent with other good theories, and they are not easily adaptable to explain anything. Here we argue that, rather than a lack of distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research, an abundance of flexible theories is a better explanation for current replicability problems of psychology. We also explain why popular methods-oriented solutions fail to address the real problem of flexibility. Instead, we propose that a greater emphasis on theory criticism by argument would improve replicability.",

We review these shortcomings and suggest that, after sustained negative experience, NHST should no longer be the default, dominant statistical practice of all biomedical and psychological research. If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published. The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out.",

            "abstract": "Childhood and adolescence are critical stages of the human lifespan, in which fundamental neural reorganizational processes take place. A substantial body of literature investigated accompanying neurophysiological changes, focusing on the most dominant feature of the human EEG signal: the alpha oscillation. Recent developments in EEG signal-processing show that conventional measures of alpha power are confounded by various factors and need to be decomposed into periodic and aperiodic components, which represent distinct underlying brain mechanisms. It is therefore unclear how each part of the signal changes during brain maturation. Using multivariate Bayesian generalized linear models, we examined aperiodic and periodic parameters of alpha activity in the largest openly available pediatric dataset (N=2529, age 5-22 years) and replicated these findings in a preregistered analysis of an independent validation sample (N=369, age 6-22 years). First, the welldocumented age-related decrease in total alpha power was replicated. However, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, our findings provided strong evidence for an age-related increase in the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. As reported in previous studies, also relative alpha power revealed a maturational increase, yet indicating an underestimation of the underlying relationship between periodic alpha power and brain maturation. The aperiodic intercept and slope decreased with increasing age and were highly correlated with total alpha power. Consequently, earlier interpretations on age-related changes of total alpha power need to be reconsidered, as elimination of active synapses rather links to decreases in the aperiodic intercept. Instead, analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data indicate that the maturational increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power is related to increased thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, our results suggest that increased thalamic control of cortical alpha power is linked to improved attentional performance during brain maturation.",

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The sociocultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of ‚Äúscreen captures‚Äù for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.",

Here, we carry out key analyses of the P300 elicited by transient auditory and visual targets to examine its potential role as a ‚Äúdecision variable‚Äù signal that accumulates evidence to a decision bound. Consistent with the latter, we find that the P300 reaches a stereotyped amplitude immediately prior to response execution and that its rate of rise scales with target detection difficulty and accounts for trial-to-trial variance in RT. Computational simulations of an accumulation-to-bound decision process faithfully captured P300 dynamics when its parameters were set by model fits to the RT distributions. Thus, where the dominant explanatory accounts have conceived of the P300 as a unitary neural event, our data reveal it to be a dynamically evolving neural signature of decision formation. These findings place the P300 at the heart of a mechanistically principled framework for understanding decision-making in both the typical and atypical human brain.",

            "abstract": "The P300 component of the human event-related potential has been the subject of intensive experimental investigation across a five-decade period, owing to its apparent relevance to a wide range of cognitive functions and its sensitivity to numerous brain disorders, yet its exact contribution to cognition remains unresolved. Here, we carry out key analyses of the P300 elicited by transient auditory and visual targets to examine its potential role as a ‚Äúdecision variable‚Äù signal that accumulates evidence to a decision bound. Consistent with the latter, we find that the P300 reaches a stereotyped amplitude immediately prior to response execution and that its rate of rise scales with target detection difficulty and accounts for trial-to-trial variance in RT. Computational simulations of an accumulation-to-bound decision process faithfully captured P300 dynamics when its parameters were set by model fits to the RT distributions. Thus, where the dominant explanatory accounts have conceived of the P300 as a unitary neural event, our data reveal it to be a dynamically evolving neural signature of decision formation. These findings place the P300 at the heart of a mechanistically principled framework for understanding decision-making in both the typical and atypical human brain.",

            "abstract": "Auxiliary hypotheses (AHs) are indispensable in hypothesis-testing, because without them specification of testable predictions and consequently falsification is impossible. However, as AHs enter the test along with the main hypothesis, non-corroborative findings are ambiguous. Due to this ambiguity, AHs may also be employed to deflect falsification by providing ‚Äúalternative explanations‚Äù of findings. This is not fatal to the extent that AHs are independently validated and safely relegated to background knowledge. But this is not always possible, especially in the so-called ‚Äúsofter‚Äù sciences where often theories are loosely organized, measurements are noisy, and constructs are vague. The Systematic Replications Framework (SRF) provides a methodological solution by disentangling the implications of the findings for the main hypothesis and the AHs through pre-planned series of systematically interlinked close and conceptual replications. SRF facilitates testing alternative explanations associated with different AHs and thereby increases test severity across a battery of tests. In this way, SRF assesses whether the corroboration of a hypothesis is conditional on particular AHs, and thus allows for a more objective evaluation of its empirical support and whether post hoc modifications to the theory are progressive or degenerative in the Lakatosian sense. Finally, SRF has several advantages over randomization-based systematic replication proposals, which generally assume a problematic neo-operationalist approach that prescribes exploration-oriented strategies in confirmatory contexts.",

Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this paper, we present the Network Comparison Test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of 1) network structure, 2) edge (connection) strength, and 3) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: the Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed.",

In order to quantify the processes that underlie performance on the BART, Wallsten, Pleskac, and Lejuez (2005) proposed a series of mathematical models whose parameters have a clear psychological interpretation. Here we examine a 2-parameter simplification of Wallsten et al.‚Äôs preferred 4-parameter model. A parameter recovery study shows that ‚Äî with plausible restrictions on the number of participants and trials ‚Äî both parameters (i.e., risk taking Œ≥ + and response consistency Œ≤) can be estimated accurately. To demonstrate how the 2-parameter model can be used in practice, we implemented a Bayesian hierarchical version and applied it to an empirical data set in which participants performed the BART following various amounts of alcohol intake.",

            "abstract": "Despite a well-documented global burden of disease attributable to alcohol use disorder (AUD), treatment seeking rates remain low. In this qualitative literature review, we address treatment seeking for AUD from a host of perspectives and summarize the literature on key factors. First, we summarize the rates of alcohol treatment seeking across various epidemiological surveys, spanning decades. Second, we discuss the definition of treatment seeking and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is typically considered formal treatment. Third, we consider timing and discuss ‚Äúwhen‚Äù individuals are most likely to seek treatment. Fourth, we review the literature on ‚Äúwho‚Äù is most likely to seek treatment, including demographic and clinical correlates. Fifth, we address the critical question of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù so few people receive clinical services for AUD, relative to the number of individuals affected by the disorder, and review barriers to treatment seeking at the treatment- and person-levels of analysis. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve treatment seeking rates by focusing on tangible points of intervention. Specifically, we recommend a host of adaptations to models of care including efforts to make treatment more appealing across stages of AUD severity, accept a range of health-enhancing drinking goals as opposed to an abstinence-only model, educate providers and consumers about evidence-based behavioral and pharmacological treatments, and incentivize the delivery of evidence-based services.",

Traditionally, hypotheses on P3b have conceived of this component being independent from implementing the response to the present stimulus. This has changed in the recent decade when P3b has been related to aspects of the decision process. The present review first focusses on effects of the classic variables stimulus frequency and relevance on P3b amplitude. It turns out that already these effects are related to response requirements because effects of stimulus frequency actually are effects of frequency of response-defined stimulus categories and effects of relevance may be defined as effects of graduating the response requirements. Then, constructs and hypotheses on psychological functions reflected by P3b are evaluated for their abilities in explaining those effects. The tested constructs are information, relevance, and capacity, and the hypotheses are priming, cognitive processing, memory storage, context updating, closure, response facilitation, decision, stimulus‚Äìresponse (S‚ÄìR) link reactivation, and conscious representations. S‚ÄìR link reactivation hypothesis performed best, closely followed by memory storage and closure hypotheses. To make further progress, more studies should conduct tests between competing hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "There are certain characteristics of psychopathy that may be related to changes in intertemporal choices. Specifically, traits such as impulsivity or lack of inhibitory control may be associated with a more pronounced discounting function in intertemporal choices (IC) and, in turn, this function may be based on changes in the basic mechanisms of time estimation (TE). Therefore, this study aimed to examine potential differences in neurophysiological correlates, specifically through N1, P3, and LPP measurements, which may be related to TE and IC, examining their modulation according to psychopathic traits, different emotional conditions, and different decision-making conditions. This experimental study included 67 adult participants (48 women) from the northern region of Portugal, who performed an intertemporal decision-making task and, of those, 19 participants (16 women), with a mean age of 25 years (SD = 5.41) and a mean of 16 years of schooling (SD = 3.37) performed the time estimation task. The instruments/measures applied were MoCA, used as a neurocognitive screening tool; the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM), a self-report instrument with 58 items that map the core features of psychopathy along three facets ‚Äì boldness, meanness, and disinhibition ‚Äì and considers them continuously distributed among the general population; intertemporal decision-making and time estimation tasks ‚Äì for the time estimation task, the stimuli consisted of 45 color images extracted from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS). In the TE task, there was an almost significant effect of disinhibition on the values of Œ∏, with higher values on this variable associated with greater values of Œ∏ in the unpleasant emotional condition. In the IC task, there were no significant effects of any psychopathy measure on the values of the gains and losses ratios. In addition, the analysis of the neurophysiological correlates of the IC task did not reveal a main effect of the decision-making condition, nor effects of any psychopathy measure on the N1 and P3 amplitudes. The analysis of the neurophysiological correlates of the TE task revealed that higher meanness values are associated with smaller N1 amplitude in the pleasant emotional condition, whereas higher disinhibition values are associated with greater N1 amplitude in the pleasant emotional condition. Still in this task, higher disinhibition values were associated with a smaller LPP amplitude in the unpleasant emotional condition. The increase in the distribution of attention resources towards time and/or the increase in activation states, including those originated by responses to emotional stimuli, may be the main factor that alters the way impulsive individuals and, presumably, individuals with high psychopathy, consider time when making decisions. The scientific study of the biological basis of intelligence has been contributing to our understanding of individual differences in cognitive abilities for decades. In particular, the ongoing development of electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and genetic methods has created new opportunities to gain insights into pressing questions, allowing the field to come closer towards a comprehensive theory that explains how genotypes exert their influence on human intelligence through intermediate biological and cognitive endophenotypes. The aim of this article is to provide a focused overview of empirical benchmark findings on biological correlates of intelligence. Specifically, we summarize benchmark findings from electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and genetic research. Moreover, we discuss four open questions: (1) The robustness of research findings; (2) the relation between neural parameters and cognitive processes; (3) promising methodological developments; and (4) theory development. The aim of this paper is to assemble the most important and robust findings on the biological basis of intelligence to stimulate future research and to contribute to theory development. The P3b is an extensively studied neurophysiological phenomenon that is predominantly explained in the cognitive neuroscience literature as reflecting context updating, presumably in working memory (WM). Despite the prevalence and influence of the context updating hypothesis, direct empirical support for the role of WM updating in eliciting the P3b is still missing. The present study was designed to address the empirical gap in understanding the functional role of P3b in general, and specifically in relation to WM updating. A mass-univariate approach was used to test the unique contribution of WM updating, categorization, and stimulus probability to the P3b. The results indicated that the P3b is only modulated by the categorization process, a finding that challenges the WM updating hypothesis. Taken together these results, we suggest that the P3b reflects a WM guided target identification mechanism, which operates as part of a goal-directed learning strategy. The ability to exert cognitive control is a major function of the prefrontal cortex, the efficiency of which depends on the phasic release of norepinephrine (NE) at particular time points. However, different aspects of information are simultaneously processed at any given moment. This raises the question of whether the norepinephrine system is also capable of specifically modulating selected aspects of all ongoing information processing, especially when several of those processes are carried out by the same functional neuroanatomical structure at the same time. We examine this question in humans using a flanker paradigm by integrating neurophysiological (EEG) and pupil diameter data using novel signal processing techniques including Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) and source localization. We show that during conflict monitoring, motor response-related processes are more strongly modulated by the NE system than stimulus-related processes or central decision processes between stimulus and response. This was the case even though these processes occurred at the same time point and were mediated by overlapping medial frontal cortical structures. The results indicate that the NE system exerts specific modulatory effects for different informational contents that are simultaneously processed in the medial frontal cortex. The P3 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is large at posterior scalp sites with rare go stimuli (go-P3) and at anterior sites with rare no-go stimuli (no-go P3). Most hypotheses on P3, including our S-R link reactivation notion, imply that these characteristics are independent of specific response modes. This assumption was here investigated by comparing ERPs between key-pressing and covert counting responses in oddball tasks that required responses to either frequent or rare stimuli. Replicating previous results, topographic differences between parietal rare go-P3 and fronto-central rare no-go P3 were much reduced with counting compared to key-press responses. Besides, while go-P3 was generally more positive than no-go P3 in the key-press tasks (except for fronto-central no-go P3 with rare stimuli) the reverse was true in the counting tasks. Thus, the characteristic posterior and fronto-central go and no-go topographies appear to be specific to hand movements. Moreover, P3s evoked in counting tasks might not simply be P3 proper, uncontaminated by movement-related potentials, but rather the go/no-go logic might differ between counting and key-pressing, with the oddball effects being affected by specific processes implemented for these particular response modes. We compared the effect of locking the event-related potentials (ERPs) on the stimulus vs. the response in a simple (SRT) and in a discriminative (DRT, equally probable Go/No-go) visuo-motor task. The accurate alignment of stimulus- and response-locked ERPs on the same time scale was obtained selecting a group of 27 participants with low inter-individual response time (RT) variation in the two tasks to reduce the jitter of RTs. Two-second epochs were defined for the analyses based on averaged RTs in the two tasks. Results show that the preparatory pre-stimulus activities (i.e., the pN and the BP components) were not affected by the different locking in both SRT and DRT. As expected, the exogenous post-stimulus P1 and N1 components (and the P2, present only in SRT) were larger in stimulus- than response-locked averaging; the same trend was observed for the less-known prefrontal N1 and P1 components (pN1 and pP1) that were larger in stimulus-locked averaging (the effect was not significant in SRT). The prefrontal pP2 component was only present in DRT peaking around 370 ms, and did not show an effect of locking. The frontal-central N2 component was enhanced by response-locked averaging in SRT, while it did not show effects of locking in DRT. The P3 component peaked at about 350 ms over central sites in SRT, and at about 500 ms over parietal sites in DRT; in both cases its amplitude was larger in response- than in stimulus-locked averaging. Overall, the amplitude of the preparatory components was independent from locking, the exogenous components were enhanced by stimulus locking, and the late components were more related to the response than to the stimulus. Concluding, to investigate action preparation, perception, and perceptual-decisional activity ERP studies should adopt stimulus-locked averaging with an appropriate baseline and longer pre-stimulus interval, or use both types of locking.",

            "abstract": ", Drug consumption is driven by a drug‚Äôs pharmacological effects, which are experienced as rewarding, and is influenced by genetic, developmental, and psychosocial factors that mediate drug accessibility, norms, and social support systems or lack thereof. The reinforcing effects of drugs mostly depend on dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic drug exposure triggers glutamatergic-mediated neuroadaptations in dopamine striato-thalamo-cortical (predominantly in prefrontal cortical regions including orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) and limbic pathways (amygdala and hippocampus) that, in vulnerable individuals, can result in addiction. In parallel, changes in the extended amygdala result in negative emotional states that perpetuate drug taking as an attempt to temporarily alleviate them. Counterintuitively, in the addicted person, the actual drug consumption is associated with an attenuated dopamine increase in brain reward regions, which might contribute to drug-taking behavior to compensate for the difference between the magnitude of the expected reward triggered by the conditioning to drug cues and the actual experience of it. Combined, these effects result in an enhanced motivation to ‚Äúseek the drug‚Äù (energized by dopamine increases triggered by drug cues) and an impaired prefrontal top-down self-regulation that favors compulsive drug-taking against the backdrop of negative emotionality and an enhanced interoceptive awareness of ‚Äúdrug hunger.‚Äù Treatment interventions intended to reverse these neuroadaptations show promise as therapeutic approaches for addiction.",

            "abstract": "Temporal measures (latencies) in the event-related potentials of the EEG (ERPs) are a valuable tool for estimating the timing of mental processes, one which takes full advantage of the high temporal resolution of the EEG. Especially in larger scale studies using a multitude of individual EEG-based tasks, the quality of latency measures often suffers from high and low frequency noise residuals due to the resulting low trial counts (because of compressed tasks) and because of the limited feasibility of visual inspection of the large-scale data. In the present study, we systematically evaluated two different approaches to latency estimation (peak latencies and fractional area latencies) with respect to their data quality and the application of noise reduction by jackknifing methods. Additionally, we tested the recently introduced method of Standardized Measurement Error (SME) to prune the dataset. We demonstrate that fractional area latency in pruned and jackknifed data may amplify within-subjects effect sizes dramatically in the analyzed data set. Between-subjects effects were less affected by the applied procedures, but remained stable regardless of procedure.",

            "abstract": "Event probability has been traditionally regarded as the major determinant of P3b amplitudes, with amplitudes increasing when stimuli are less likely. Here we show in a simple variant of the continuous performance task that this \"oddball effect\" does not universally apply. Stimuli were a continuous series of (A or B) -> (X or Y) pairs, with the letter X requiring a key-press response and occurring in 80% of trials after A and in 20% after B (vice versa the Y). P3b amplitudes were equally large with probable and improbable occurrence of X. This was in contrast to visual Mismatch Negativity which was consistently larger with less probable stimuli, and also in contrast to no-go P3 amplitudes, which were larger with improbable than probable Y. The only effect on P3b amplitude was due to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA): P3b was larger with SOAs of 2000¬†ms compared to 1500¬†ms. This result dovetails with previous evidence in the oddball task that the main determinant of the oddball effect is not event probability but rather time interval between stimuli. The absence of probability effects on P3b was in sharp contrast to the presence of these effects on no-go P3. Implications are discussed for theories about the psychological meaning of the P3b component.",

            "abstract": "Social scientists often seek to demonstrate that a construct has incremental validity over and above other related constructs. However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest‚Äîin some cases approaching 100%‚Äîwhen sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.",

            "abstract": "Secondary data analysis, or the analysis of preexisting data, provides a powerful tool for the resourceful psychological scientist. Never has this been more true than now, when technological advances enable both sharing data across labs and continents and mining large sources of preexisting data. However, secondary data analysis is easily overlooked as a key domain for developing new open-science practices or improving analytic methods for robust data analysis. In this article, we provide researchers with the knowledge necessary to incorporate secondary data analysis into their methodological toolbox. We explain that secondary data analysis can be used for either exploratory or confirmatory work, and can be either correlational or experimental, and we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of this type of research. We describe how transparency-enhancing practices can improve and alter interpretations of results from secondary data analysis and discuss approaches that can be used to improve the robustness of reported results. We close by suggesting ways in which scientific subfields and institutions could address and improve the use of secondary data analysis.",

We highlight efforts to overcome current challenges by focusing on the emerging field of computational psychiatry, which might enable the field to move from a symptom-based description of mental illness to descriptors based on objective computational multidimensional functional variables. We survey recent efforts toward this goal and describe a set of methods that together form a toolbox to aid this research program. We identify four levels in computational psychiatry: (a) behavioral tasks that index various psychological processes, (b) computational models that identify the generative psychological processes, (c) parameter-estimation methods concerned with quantitatively fitting these models to subject behavior by focusing on hierarchical Bayesian estimation as a rich framework with many desirable properties, and (d) machine-learning clustering methods that identify clinically significant conditions and subgroups of individuals. As a proof of principle, we apply these methods to two different data sets. Finally, we highlight challenges for future research.",

            "abstract": "Human learning, at least in part, appears to be dependent on the evaluation of how outcomes of our actions align with our expectations. Over the past 23 years, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to probe the neural signatures of feedback processing. Seminal work demonstrated a difference in the human event-related potential (ERP) dependent on whether people were processing correct or incorrect feedback. Since then, these feedback evoked ERPs have been associated with reinforcement learning and conflict monitoring, tied to subsequent behavioral adaptations, and shown to be sensitive to a wide range of factors (e.g., Parkinson‚Äôs disease). Recently, research has turned to frequency decomposition techniques to examine how changes in the EEG power spectra are related to underlying learning mechanisms. Although the literature on the neural correlates of feedback processing is vast, there are still methodological discrepancies and differences in results across studies. Here, we provide reference results and an investigation of methodological considerations for the ERP (reward positivity) and frequency (delta and theta power) correlates of feedback evaluation with a large sample size. Specifically, participants (n = 500) performed a two-armed bandit task while we recorded EEG. Our findings provide key information about the data characteristics and relationships that exist between the neural signatures of feedback evaluation. Additionally, we conclude with selected methodological recommendations for standardization of future research. All data and scripts are freely provided to facilitate open science.",

            "abstract": "Alcohol is a major contributor to global disease and a leading cause of preventable death, causing approximately 88,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Alcohol use disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with nearly one-third of U.S. adults experiencing alcohol use disorder at some point during their lives. Alcohol use disorder also has economic consequences, costing the United States at least $249 billion annually. Current pharmaceutical and behavioral treatments may assist patients in reducing alcohol use or facilitating alcohol abstinence. Although recent research has expanded understanding of alcohol use disorder, more research is needed to identify the neurobiological, genetic and epigenetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors most critical in the etiology and treatment of this disease. Implementation of this knowledge in clinical practice and training of health care providers is also needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of individuals suffering from alcohol use disorder.",

New methods of delivery and successful adjuncts to existing behavioral treatments also have been introduced, including computerized cognitive‚Äìbehavioral treatments, Web-based guided self-change, and mindfulness-based approaches.

            "abstract": "Time is an important dimension when individuals make decisions. Specifically, the time until a beneficial outcome can be received is viewed as a cost and is weighed against the benefits of the outcome. We propose that impulsive individuals experience time differently, that is with a higher cost. Impulsive subjects, therefore, overestimate the duration of time intervals and, as a consequence, discount the value of delayed rewards more strongly than do self-controlled individuals. The literature on time perception and impulsivity, however, is not clear cut and needs a better theoretical foundation. Here, we develop the theoretical background on concepts of time perception, which could lead to an empirically based notion of the association between an altered sense of time and impulsivity.",

Consistent with earlier reports, Ericsson and colleagues concluded that heuristic models (specifically their novel intertemporal choice heuristic or ITCH model) explain intertemporal choices better than discounting models do. More surprisingly, their results showed that all discounting models performed nearly at chance level, and did not outperform even the baseline model. In this article, however, we demonstrate that these conclusions are premature. Specifically, we reanalyzed the Ericson et al. (2015) data under different, arguably more appropriate, conditions and found that models of both classes are rather good at predicting choice. We conclude that the jury is still out on which (type of) model is best and end by making suggestions towards conducting more informative model comparisons.",

We conducted an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study to investigate the effects of substance use on delay discounting in a sample of people who use stimulants (HIV+: 30; HIV‚àí: 34). Participants completed multiple EMAs throughout the day for 28 days. The EMAs collected data on delay discounting and substance use (time since last substance use and level of intoxication). Delay discounting was assessed using a brief Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). Analyses were conducted using linear mixed effects modeling. Most participants (99.1%) used cocaine as their primary stimulant. Among participants without HIV, MCQ score remained relatively stable during the first 2 hr after stimulant use, followed by an increase during 2‚Äì6 hr (p < .05), before decreasing again. For alcohol and marijuana, the MCQ score was stable during the first 4 hr after use, with a sharp increase at 4‚Äì6 hr (p < .05), before decreasing again. Among participants with HIV, there were no changes in MCQ score as a function of time since recent substance use. These findings provide evidence of a plausible connection between delay discounting and acute withdrawal that may have relevance for risky behaviors.

            "abstract": "Background Recent studies have examined the effect of computerized cognitive training on working memory (WM), but the behavioral and neural effects were uncertain. Also, few studies have explored WM training effects on children using event-related potentials. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of WM training in children, including the effects on behavioral performance and neurophysiological outcomes. Methods Forty-four healthy children (mean age = 7.76 years, SD = 0.57 years, 18 females) were assigned to the training and control groups. Over 20 training sessions, the training group participated in the computation-span and spatial N-back tasks, whereas the control group joined in normal class activities. They all completed the pre- and post-test evaluation of WM tasks (digit span backwards task and N-back task). Results The results showed that WM training led to improved performance in the digit span backwards task and 2-back task of post-test evaluation, shortened P3a and P3b latencies in nontarget trials during the spatial 1-back task, shortened P3a latency in target and nontarget trials, as well as increased P3b amplitude and shortened P3b latency in target trials during the spatial 2-back task. Conclusions These results suggested that WM training might enhance children‚Äôs behavioral performance on WM tasks and brought about neurophysiological changes. This study gives insights into the potential of WM training effects on children‚Äôs behavioral performance and neurophysiological outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior. Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology?s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.",

            "abstract": "Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned ‚Äì that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology ‚Äìthe linear mixed model ‚Äì I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers‚Äô actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the ‚Äúrandom effect‚Äù formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology‚Äôs ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "Background The US National Institutes of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) seek to stimulate research into biologically validated neuropsychological dimensions across mental illness symptoms and diagnoses. The RDoC framework comprises 39 functional constructs designed to be revised and refined, with the overall goal of improving diagnostic validity and treatments. This study aimed to reach a consensus among experts in the addiction field on the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù RDoC constructs most relevant to substance and behavioural addictions. Methods Forty-four addiction experts were recruited from Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The Delphi technique was used to determine a consensus as to the degree of importance of each construct in understanding the essential dimensions underpinning addictive behaviours. Expert opinions were canvassed online over three rounds (97% completion rate), with each consecutive round offering feedback for experts to review their opinions. Results Seven constructs were endorsed by ‚â• 80% of experts as ‚Äúprimary‚Äù to the understanding of addictive behaviour: five from the Positive Valence System (reward valuation, expectancy, action selection, reward learning, habit); one from the Cognitive Control System (response selection/inhibition); and one expert-initiated construct (compulsivity). These constructs were rated to be related differentially to stages of the addiction cycle, with some linked more closely to addiction onset and others more to chronicity. Experts agreed that these neuropsychological dimensions apply across a range of addictions. Conclusions The study offers a novel and neuropsychologically informed theoretical framework, as well as a cogent step forward to test transdiagnostic concepts in addiction research, with direct implications for assessment, diagnosis, staging of disorder, and treatment.",

The most widely used methods such as t test and ANOVA do not take data dependence into account and thus are often misused. This Primer introduces linear and generalized mixed-effects models that consider data dependence and provides clear instruction on how to recognize when they are needed and how to apply them. The appropriate use of mixed-effects models will help researchers improve their experimental design and will lead to data analyses with greater validity and higher reproducibility of the experimental findings.",

There is a growing body of literature on neurotoxic and harmful cognitive effects of drinking by young people. On average, youths take their first drink at age 12 years. Methods. MEDLINE search on neurologic and cognitive effects of underage drinking. Results. Problematic alcohol consumption is not a benign condition that resolves with age. Individuals who first use alcohol before age 14 years are at increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders. Underage drinkers are susceptible to immediate consequences of alcohol use, including blackouts, hangovers, and alcohol poisoning and are at elevated risk of neurodegeneration (particularly in regions of the brain responsible for learning and memory), impairments in functional brain activity, and the appearance of neurocognitive deficits. Heavy episodic or binge drinking impairs study habits and erodes the development of transitional skills to adulthood. Conclusions. Underage alcohol use is associated with brain damage and neurocognitive deficits, with implications for learning and intellectual development. Impaired intellectual development may continue to affect individuals into adulthood. It is imperative for policymakers and organized medicine to address the problem of underage drinking.",

Individuals who first use alcohol before age 14 years are at increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders. Underage drinkers are susceptible to immediate consequences of alcohol use, including blackouts, hangovers, and alcohol poisoning and are at elevated risk of neurodegeneration (particularly in regions of the brain responsible for learning and memory), impairments in functional brain activity, and the appearance of neurocognitive deficits. Heavy episodic or binge drinking impairs study habits and erodes the development of transitional skills to adulthood. Conclusions. Underage alcohol use is associated with brain damage and neurocognitive deficits, with implications for learning and intellectual development. Impaired intellectual development may continue to affect individuals into adulthood. It is imperative for policymakers and organized medicine to address the problem of underage drinking.",

            "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used for the detection of anxiety because of its ability to reflect the functional activities of the brain. However, EEG alone may not provide precision in the detection of anxiety because other emotional disorders usually trigger the same changes in brain function. To discover effective diagnostic indicators and to achieve more precise anxiety detection, we integrate eye movement information into EEG and divide the features into groups according to their respective characteristics. Then, we use group sparse canonical correlation analysis (GSCCA) to investigate group structure information among EEG and eye movement features and obtain an effective fusion representation of EEG and eye movement to achieve more precise detection of anxiety mood. The experimental results from 45 anxious subjects and 47 normal controls from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset showed that GSCCA could be effectively used to explore the correlation between EEG features within different scalp regions and eye movement features from several aspects. Visual behaviors, including saccades and fixation, are more linearly related to the power spectrum of EEG on the scalp area corresponding to the visual region of the brain. The ultimate fusion representation achieved an optimal classification accuracy of 82.70 percent with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the gamma band of EEG.",

            "abstract": "Background It is difficult to distinguish between bipolar disorder (BD) and unipolar disorder (UD) depression. Given the different pattern of cognitive impairments between BD and UD, P300 is potentially useful for the differential diagnosis. This meta-analysis was performed to estimate the extent of difference in P300 in patients with BD versus UD depression. Methods Studies comparing P300 between depressed BD and UD patients with or without healthy controls (HCs) were retrieved from major English and Chinese databases. Studies with BD and UD samples that were comparable in terms of age, gender, and depression severity, were rated as having high quality. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) of P300 latency and amplitude were calculated. Results In total, eight studies with a total of 397 depressed BD patients, 390 depressed UD patients, and 497 HCs, were included. Among included studies, six were rated as having good quality and three followed BD (n‚ÄÜ=‚ÄÜ146) and UD (n‚ÄÜ=‚ÄÜ144) patients during remission. BD patients had significantly longer P300 latency than UD patients during major depressive episode [SMD (95%CI): 0.580 (0.309, 0.850)] and remission [SMD (95%CI): 1.583 (1.322, 1.844)]. Compared to HCs, remitted BD patients still had significantly longer P300 latency [SMD (95%CI): 0.857 (0.059, 1.656)] but P300 latency of remitted UD patients had decreased to normal [SMD (95%CI): 0.536 (‚àí0.272, 1.343)]. Limitations Sample sizes of depressed and remitted patients with BD and UD of included studies are small. Conclusions P300 latency can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic marker for differentiating BD from UD depression.",

            "abstract": "A multitude of psychological and social factors likely contribute to the development and maintenance of addictive disorders. As different people develop different addictions, it is important to understand whether psychosocial factors are related differently to different types of addictive disorders. In this study, we examined the unique interaction of personality traits, family environment, and life events in predicting substance (drugs, alcohol) and behavioral (gambling, sex) addictive disorders, among 207 participants suffering from an addictive disorder and 79 controls. Results identified several psychosocial factors, including impulsivity and reported negative life events, that predicted all types of addictive disorders. There was also a unique prediction model for each addiction. Drug and alcohol use disorders were predicted by lower agreeableness and less intellectual-cultural family orientation, with alcohol use disorder further predicted by lower extraversion and higher family organization. Gambling disorder was predicted by a family with lower intellectual-cultural orientation and higher organization and control, whereas compulsive sexual behavior was predicted by lower extraversion and agreeableness and higher neuroticism, and by higher family control. These findings suggest that the complex interplay among psychosocial factors is manifested differently across addictive disorders and may thus have important implications for research, prevention, and intervention.",

The aforementioned state causes distress and/or functional impairments. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluated the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT with an SSRIs intervention program. The participants comprised 16 children and adolescents with GAD (8 males and 8 females) matched with 16 typically developing peers (8 males and 8 females) aged from 10 to 16 years old (M = 12.56 SD = 2.18). Baseline assessment consisted of event related potentials (ERPs), which indicated that participants with GAD presented cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as they exhibited longer P300 latencies. Following treatment with the CBT program and/or medication, children and adolescents with GAD did not present statistically significantly longer P300 latencies and reaction times in comparison to the control group. Lastly, children and adolescents who followed the CBT program or the CBT program with psychopharmacological assistance did not reveal statistically significant differences in 13 out of 15 topographic brain areas and in reaction time.",
