Aim: Create a table with of subjects with EEG and Behavior data Data: HBN/EEG-ET_Joelle_MA_results Behavioral: _vis_learn.mat EEG: (g)ip.mat 1.1.1 Details Noisy channels were excluded: noisy_chan = [1 8 14 17 21 25 32 48 49 56 63 68 73 81 88 94 99 107 113 119 125 126 127 128]; Triggers (depending on sequence length): trigger = [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]; trigger = [11,12,13,14,15,16]; Categories are created: UN, NL, K, F Accuracy is created: 0/1 (correct/false) Distance from newly learned is created if a location is forgotten over 5 blocks then this location (or trial) is removed = NaN if not NaN: having a forgotten trial would leads to two NL or zero distance example of NaN location: NL -&gt; K -&gt; F -&gt; UN -&gt; NL Eye tracking For eye tracking it was looked at whether the subject was looking at the screen during stimulus presentation. If not, or no eye tracking data was found, then an index with 0 was created for that trial. Filtering EEG = pop_eegfiltnew(EEG,[],45); Re-referencing EEG = pop_reref(EEG, [], &#39;keepref&#39;, &#39;on&#39;); Segmentation depending on sequence length: EEG = pop_epoch(EEG, {11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18}, [-0.1 0.8]); EEG = pop_epoch(EEG, {11,12,13,14,15,16}, [-0.1 0.8]); Baseline correction -100:0 ms was subtracted from the signal. Artifact rejection was done with baseline corrected data and the trials index were saved. For table without baseline correction no additional artifact rejection was done. Thus, simply using the index to reject trials. Artifact rejection Trials to reject were selected by controlling if any electrodes during -100:800 ms had an amplitude higher than 90 uV or lower than -90 uV. squeeze(sum(sum([full_table.Var5{idx4}(1:105,:) &gt; thresh| (full_table.Var5{idx4}(1:105,:)&lt; -thresh)],1),2)==0) this command first creates logical table with 1 being higher/lower than 90/-90. Then the sum of coloumns is formed (all electrodes) and than the sum of dimension 2 (sample) if formed. If 1 than trial without artifact. Reject file: reject{1, index} = id; reject{2, index} = sum(ind); how many no artifact reject{3, index} = length(ind);% total trials Select electrodes (without CZ) channels = logical(E54 + E55 + E61 + E62 + E78 + E79); create one ERP out of selected electrodes 1.1.2 saved Files save rejected.mat reject full_tab save full_tab.mat full_tab 1.2 a2_add_demo In this script the table generated by a1_table_EEG_BD is used to add multiple variables. The data comes from excel file: bd = readtable(&quot;C:\\Users\\Oli\\OneDrive - Universität Zürich UZH\\Master3\\MA\\Excel HBN\\BD.csv&quot;); Variables created: Primary Diagnose (DX01) All diagnosis Comorbitity Gender Age Age group Index for No behavioral/demo data The age groups are created with bins of two years up to 17 years. All subjects older than 17 form one group. Furthermore, in this script explores how many subject out of full_tab will be excluded because of too many bad trials (reject file, see a1_table_EEG_BD) 1.2.1 Details Argument N Not in excel 90 0% good trials 111 100% good trials 132 &lt; 75% good trials 1003 &lt; 50% good trials 350 &lt; 50% good trials &amp; in full_tab 249 Sequence Length == 7 546 Trial influence on power 50% of trials = square(0.5) of original SNR. 0.75 of trials = 86% of original SNR (Luck 2014). Knowledge Index &amp; Learning Index The Knowledge Index and Learning Index were calculated in line with the paper of (Steinemann et al. 2016) with the following forumla: \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Knowledge Index}(S,b) &amp;= \\frac{n_K(S,b)+ 0.5*n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\text{Learning Index}(S,b) &amp;=\\frac{n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\\\ \\text{where}~S &amp;= \\text{Subject,} \\\\ b &amp;= \\text{Block,}\\\\ K &amp;= \\text{Known Stimuli,}\\\\ NL &amp;= \\text{Newly Learned Stimuli,}\\\\ T &amp;= \\text{Total Stimuli}\\\\ \\end{align} \\] A second Knowledge Index without the weight of 0.5 was calculated as well since the experimental desgin differs from the one in (Steinemann et al. 2016): \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Knowledge Index}(S,b) &amp;= \\frac{n_K(S,b)+ n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\\\ \\text{where}~S &amp;= \\text{Subject,} \\\\ b &amp;= \\text{Block,}\\\\ K &amp;= \\text{Known Stimuli,}\\\\ NL &amp;= \\text{Newly Learned Stimuli,}\\\\ T &amp;= \\text{Total Stimuli (artifact free)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Learning Index}(S,b) &amp;= \\frac{n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\\\ \\text{where}~S &amp;= \\text{Subject,} \\\\ b &amp;= \\text{Block,}\\\\ NL &amp;= \\text{Newly Learned Stimuli,}\\\\ T &amp;= \\text{Total Stimuli (artifact free)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\] Reject File The reject file was modified to show which to be rejected subjects are not found in full_tab. Furthermore, the age of all found subjects was included in the 7th row to further see the age distribution of rejected subjects. 1.2.2 Saved Files full_tab with demo saved as full_tab_a2 save full_tab_a2.mat full_tab file with index for subject without demographics save no_bd_data.mat idx modified reject file save rejected_a2.mat reject 1.3 a2_1_exlcude In this script subjects are excluded using indexes. Exclusion criteria are in ??. 1.4 a2_2_perfGroups In this script a table is formed in a wide format. Every sub has it’s own row. KI’s of every block is saved with statistics as: mean KI/LI median KI std KI min KI max KI SeqLen Age and Age group, Diagnose, Gender A variable performer is created to split the subjects in a given age group into 4 groups based on their mean KI across all blocks. These performer groups very formed by splitting the age groups subjects by median, and these two sub groups were split again by median, arriving at 4 sub groups per age groups. This is done for visualization purposes. 1.5 a3_1_topo This script uses baseline corrected data to create topoplots (see 3.3 and ??). Secondly, a third table was created with the important channels averaged together. This third table will be used for plotting ERP. 1.5.1 Details Subjects not found in full_tab from [a2_1_exclude] were excluded from the topoplot file. Age group was created. One problem which occurred is that: full_tab_topo has the same amount of subjects (i.e., n = 1599) but 2’367 trials less full_tab = 60’561 full_tab_topo = 58’194 full_tab_baseline = 57’841 (- 2’720) the reason should be somewhere in a1_table_EEG_BD 1.6 a3_compute_latencies This script aims at computing p300 peak for individuals without forming a group.Using a method described in (Liesefeld 2018), the data set presented a challenge in computing individual p300 peaks. Especially, finding the offset value seemed to be the problem, since many subject had a broad positive deflection at the end of an erp. Using a time window of 300-600 ms post stimulus and increasing percAmp from 0.6 to 0.8 led to warning for 14 subjects. Still, having a percAmp of 0.8 may be too high. Therefore, processing from here p300 peak is calculated base one a time window calcuted from group erp see [Time Window, Electrodes]. 1.6.1 Figures The following figure 1.1 shows the individual ERP of subjects between age 5 to 7 with an percAmp of 0.6. To make it more visable only a subset of subjects out of that age group were plotted. For example, finding an offset for subject 19 was problematic. Figure 1.1: Individual ERP for age 5 to 7 years Generally, for older age subject finding individual peaks wasn’t a challenge (see 1.2) Figure 1.2: Individual ERP for age 18+ 1.7 a3_p300 In this script the p300 was calculated based on time window determined by p300 peak of age group ERP (see 4.1.3). One problem might be that for the youngest age group the peak p300 is most likely confounded by a underlying broad positivity. 1.8 a4_plots References "],["Intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Importance of Learning 2.2 Psychological disorders and Learning 2.3 Measuring Learning, Different Paradigms, Age differences 2.4 Why EEG 2.5 ERP, P3000, Models and Theories 2.6 Previous research 2.7 Research Gap? 2.8 Big Data 2.9 Hypothesis 2.10 Expolrative Goal", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Importance of Learning 2.2 Psychological disorders and Learning 2.3 Measuring Learning, Different Paradigms, Age differences (Conklin et al. 2007) 2.3.1 Visual Sequence Learning Using a forward spatial memory task that doesn’t draw to much on Working memory seems a suitable choice to compare a different subjects in a with a large age range as in this study, since (Conklin et al. 2007) found that “The order in which performance was mastered on each WM task during adolescence closely paralleled the order in which the substrates demonstrated to subserve these WM tasks mature developmentally”. 2.4 Why EEG 2.4.1 Biomarker and Research Domain Critica 2.5 ERP, P3000, Models and Theories 2.6 Previous research 2.7 Research Gap? 2.8 Big Data 2.9 Hypothesis 2.10 Expolrative Goal References "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Sample 3.2 Diagnosis 3.3 EEG and Age Groups 3.4 Mixed Models 3.5 Clusteranalyse", " Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Sample Figure 3.1 Shows the subjects excluding process.

It was hypothesized that performance across multiple WM tasks would improve with age. Participants (N = 117) were categorized after selection to form four roughly equally sized groups by age (9–10 years, 11–12 years, 13–15 years, and 16–17 years of age). spatial WM (Spatial Span Task from the Wechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition [WMS-III; Wechsler 1997a]) The Spatial Span Task was created to be a visual analog of the Digit Span Task (Wechsler, 1997a). The examiner tapped specified sequences of blocks of random location using a board that consists of 10 blue blocks fastened to a white plastic board. The participant was required to repeat the block taps in the same order (Spatial Span Forward) or in reverse order (Spatial Span Backwards). The number of blocks increased by one until the participant failed two trials of the same length. Forward span tasks (i.e., Digit Span Forward and Spatial Span Forward) are considered measures of attention and immediate recall. Age groups differed significantly from one another on the Digit Span Forward Task, F(3, 113) = 8.68, p &lt; .001, with the age 9–10 years group demonstrating a shorter forward span than both the age 13–15 years group (p &lt; .01) and the age 16–17 years group (p &lt; .001), and the age 11–12 years group demonstrating a shorter forward span than the age 16–17 years group (p &lt; .01). Results reported in that paper indicated a similar pattern of group differences across the Forward and Backward Spatial Span Tasks (which were analyzed together in a multivariate analysis) with children of age 9–10 years demonstrating a shorter spatial span (forward and backward) than children of age 13–15 years (p &lt; .01) and children of age 16–17 years (p &lt; .01), and children of age 11–12 years demonstrating a shorter spatial span than those of age 16–17 years (p &lt; .01). No other group differences reached significance on the Spatial Span Task. Based on current study findings, behavioral data add convergent evidence for a pattern of largely posterior-to-anterior brain development previously surmised from postmortem and neuroimaging findings. thats why younger subject larger broad positity -&gt; brain activiation doesn’t move to as much to frontal parts compared to older subjects? A number of maladaptive conditions are associated with frontal lobe pathology in childhood or adolescence, including conditions with a significant genetic contribution (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD] Knowing when and how far children with ADHD branch away from the normal trajectory with respect to performance on these frontally mediated tasks can help parents and educators anticipate needs and plan accordingly. This task-specific finding may reflect differences in underlying neurobiology, as recent research indicates differential neurotransmitter sensitivity of frontally mediated cognitive abilities in typically developing children (Diamond, Briand, Fossella, &amp; Gehlback, 2004). (Luciana et al. 2005) Across age groups, performance was superior on forward versus backward span trials. Nine- to 10-year-olds performed worse than 13- to 15-year-olds, 16- to 17-year-olds, and 18- to 20-year-olds (pso.01). Eleven- to 12-year-olds performed worse than 16- to 17year-olds (po.05) and 18- to 20-year-olds (po.01). The oldest three age groups (13- to 15-year-olds, 16to 17-year-olds, and 18- to 20-year-olds) did not differ from one another. Thus, nonverbal memory span continues to improve up to 13 to 15 years old; counter to prediction, this developmental course appears to be similar for forward and backward spatial memory span. Otherwise, no significant main effects or interactions by gender were observed. but for eeg important? ### Time Window, Electrodes In the figure 3.3 we can see that the same electrodes can be used for all age groups. Furthermore, it seems as if the older age groups have less peak amplitude with shorter duration and less broad positivity. Figure 3.3: Topoplot of age groups. Updated topoplot but not as clearly view able maybe add less time points and/or do “all ages” separately (3.4) ? Figure 3.4: Topoplot of age groups. Plotting the erp of different age groups indicates that in the younger age groups it’s possible that the p300 peak measure is confounded underlying broad positivity (see 3.5).

The mean learning rate, displayed as red dot in the figure, seems to decrease mostly from first to second block. This indicates that, when looking a sample average level, learning tends to stagnate after the first block Figure 4.1: Knowledge Index and Learning Rate. Grand Mean of LI and KI In figure (4.2) we see the grand mean of KI, LR and LR ony first two blocks Figure 4.2: Grand Mean of Index and Learning Rate. 4.1.2.1 Do Subjects Learn? The average knowledge Index across subjects doesn’t seem to increase greatly. To further explore the learning performance, the subjects were formed into four groups based on their mean Learning Rate across blocks: The subjects were split into four quintile: [0-25%] ]25-50%] ]50-75] ]75-100%] Figure 4.3 shows the knowledge index trajectory of different performers and with their standard deviation. Lower performer don’t seem to increase performance (i.e. knowledge index) in most age groups. Knowledge index was calculated without an added weight as described in a2_add_demo.
