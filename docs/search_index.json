Aim: Create a table with of subjects with EEG and Behavior data Data: HBN/EEG-ET_Joelle_MA_results Behavioral: _vis_learn.mat EEG: (g)ip.mat 1.1.1 Details Noisy channels were excluded: noisy_chan = [1 8 14 17 21 25 32 48 49 56 63 68 73 81 88 94 99 107 113 119 125 126 127 128]; Triggers: trigger = [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]; Categories are created: UN, NL, K, F Accuracy is created: 0/1 (correct/false) Distance from newly learned is created TODO: Check if this is correct.

Filtering EEG = pop_eegfiltnew(EEG,[],45); Re-referencing EEG = pop_reref(EEG, [], &#39;keepref&#39;, &#39;on&#39;); Segmentation EEG = pop_epoch(EEG, {11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18}, [-0.1 0.8]); Artifact rejection thresh = 90; ind(idx4, 1) = squeeze(sum(sum([(full_table.Var4{idx4}(1:105, :) &gt; thresh) | &gt; (full_table.Var4{idx4}(1:105, :) &lt; -thresh)],1),2) == 0); ind = logical(ind); full_table = full_table(ind,:); Reject file: reject{1, index} = id; reject{2, index} = sum(ind); % wie viele ausgeschlossen reject{3, index} = length(ind);% wie viele trials pro person Select electrodes (without CZ) channels = logical(E54 + E55 + E61 + E62 + E78 + E79); create one ERP out of selected electrodes 1.1.2 saved Files Reject with numbers of trials that are?? TODO: when reject? save rejected.mat reject full_tab save full_tab.mat full_tab 1.2 a2_add_demo In this script the table generated by a1_table_EEG_BD is used to add multiple variables. The data comes from excel file: bd = readtable(&quot;C:\\Users\\Oli\\OneDrive - Universität Zürich UZH\\Master3\\MA\\Excel HBN\\BD.csv&quot;); Variables created: Primary Diagnose (DX01) All diagnosis Comorbitity Gender Age Agegroup Index for No behavioral/demo data The age groups are created with bins of two years up to 19 years. All subjects older than 19 form one group. Furthermore, in this script explores how many subject out of full_tab will be excluded because of too many bad trials (reject file, see a1_table_EEG_BD) 1.2.1 Details Argument N Not in excel 90 0% good trials 111 100% good trials 132 &lt; 75% good trials 1003 &lt; 50% good trials 350 &lt; 50% good trials &amp; in full_tab 249 Trial influence on power 50% of trials = square(0.5) of original SNR. 0.75 of trials = 86% of original SNR (Luck 2014). Knowledge Index &amp; Learning Index The Knowledge Index and Learning Index were calculated in line with the paper of (Steinemann et al. 2016) with the following forumla: $$\\[\\begin{align} \\text{Knowledge Index}(S,b) &amp;= \\frac{n_K(S,b)+ 0.5*n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\text{Learning Index}(S,b) &amp;=\\frac{n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\\\ \\text{where}~S &amp;= \\text{Subject,} \\\\ b &amp;= \\text{Block,}\\\\ K &amp;= \\text{Known Stimuli,}\\\\ NL &amp;= \\text{Newly Learned Stimuli,}\\\\ T &amp;= \\text{Total Stimuli}\\\\ \\end{align}\\]$$ A second Knowledge Index without the weight of 0.5 was calculated as well since the experimental desgin differs from the one in (Steinemann et al. 2016): \\[\\begin{align} \\text{Knowledge Index}(S,b) &amp;= \\frac{n_K(S,b)+ n_{NL}(S,b)}{n_T(S,b)}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Reject File The reject file was modified to show which to be rejected subjects are not found in full_tab. Furthermore, the age of all found subjects was included in the 7th row to further see the age distribution of rejected subjects. 1.2.2 Saved Files full_tab with demo saved as full_tab_a2 save full_tab_a2.mat full_tab file with index for subject without demographics save no_bd_data.mat idx modified reject file save rejected_a2.mat reject 1.3 a2_1_exlcude In this script subjects are excluded using indexes. Exclusion criteria are in 3.1. 1.4 a3_1_topo This script uses baseline corrected data to create topoplots (see 3.2 and ??). Secondly, a third table was created with the important channels averaged together. This third table will be used for plotting ERP. 1.4.1 Details Subjects not found in full_tab from [a2_1_exclude] were excluded from the topoplot file. Age group was created. One problem which occurred is that: full_tab_topo has the same amount of subjects (i.e., n = 1599) but 2’367 trials less full_tab = 60’561 full_tab_topo = 58’194 full_tab_baseline = 57’841 (- 2’720) the reason should be somewhere in a1_table_EEG_BD 1.5 a3_compute_latencies This script aims at computing p300 peak for individuals without forming a group.Using a method described in (Liesefeld 2018), the data set presented a challenge in computing individual p300 peaks. Especially, finding the offset value seemed to be the problem, since many subject had a broad positive deflection at the end of an erp. Using a time window of 300-600 ms post stimulus and increasing percAmp from 0.6 to 0.8 led to warning for 14 subjects. Still, having a percAmp of 0.8 may be too high. Therefore, processing from here p300 peak is calculated base one a time window calcuted from group erp see Time Window, Electrodes. 1.5.1 Figures The following figure 1.1 shows the individual ERP of subjects between age 5 to 7 with an percAmp of 0.6. To make it more visable only a subset of subjects out of that age group were plotted. For example, finding an offset for subject 19 was problematic. Figure 1.1: Individual ERP for age 5 to 7 years Generally, for older age subject finding individual peaks wasn’t a challenge (see 1.2) Figure 1.2: Individual ERP for age 18+ 1.6 a3_p300 In this script the p300 was calculated based on time window determined by p300 peak of age group ERP (see ??). One problem might be that for the youngest age group the peak p300 is most likely confounded by a underlying broad positivity.

Furthermore, it seems as if the older age groups have less peak amplitude with shorter duration and less broad positivity. Figure 3.2: Topoplot of age groups.

Another point made in this article is that: reliability in experimental research means: finding an effect realiable and little interindividual variance. reliability in correlational research means: ranking the subjects similar across time points: larger interindividual variance.
